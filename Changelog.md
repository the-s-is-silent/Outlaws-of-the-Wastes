## A comprehensive list of changes in the mod since the Harbinger update

#### August - October 2023

**Mod Options and Game Speed Adjustments**
- The survivor camp spawn rate has been drastically reduced (but is still significantly higher than base level) after determining that the previous rate was very much overpowered.
- Pantheons now cost 30 Faith to found on Standard speed and do not increase in cost as factions gain their Pantheons.
- Every player can now found a religion.
- Passive religious pressure reduced by 50%.

**Faction and City-State Adjustments**
- Almaty can no longer build Low Tech units. Their dialogue was also changed, to give them more personality.
- Atlas now has a Mountain start bias and can no longer build Enslaved units, Prison Camps or Work Camps.
- Bartertown now starts with Redomestication, Iron Working, and Chemistry. Their declaring war line was also changed.
- Crimson Legion now has Imperial Cult as their favored religion, and can no longer build Automated or Purge Robot units.
- Cult of Ignis and Deseret Nation both lose their Turn 1 prophet from their unique Wonder (they can still get a free one from the Theocracy tree).
- Cult of Ignis gains +1 Movement to Armor units, but loses the Culture boost to Coal Plants.
- Deseret Nation loses the Iron Working and Steel starting techs along with the temporary Science penalty, and gains their bonus Enhancer belief upon founding their religion.
- The Harbingers only get one-third as much Water and Influence from CS trade missions. However, the ban on building settlers has been rescinded.
- Hexlock gains double Encrypted Data in their UA, but loses the free Construction, Machinery and Engineering techs and gets Chemistry as a free tech instead.
- The Mariners now start with Rediscovery adopted, and after adopting Advanced Piracy their Ranged Water and Personnel units also gain the Sea Raider promotion.

**Specialist Adjustments**
- Administrators no longer give Happiness. They now provide +2 Culture while active.

**Promotion Adjustments**
- Forage awards 67% less Science per kill and no longer increases XP gain, but increases healing slightly in Rubble and Ruins tiles and is now available to Shooter units.
- Skirmish is no longer available to Shooter units unless they start with the promotion or upgrade from a unit that has the promotion. Not counting expansion mods, the only Shooter unit that starts with it is the Destroying Angel, and the only Shooter unit that can inherit Skirmish by upgrading from a Scout unit is the Border Patrol.
- Consequently, Precision and Suppression now list Forage instead of Skirmish as a prerequisite promotion.
- Suppression has been nerfed to a 25% combat bonus against Melee units.
- Hazard Pay no longer allows units to move immediately upon purchase.
- Bombardment separated into Water and Air versions, with three tiers for Bomber units, and it along with Siege are removed from Fighter units.
- Siege II and III, and Interception II and III, can no longer be awarded without first choosing the previous promotion tier.
- Targeting buffed to 33% Strength bonus vs Water units.
- Sentry removed from the promotion list for Shooter and Helicopter units, and the promotion requirements are adjusted to address an error in the promotion tree.
- Survivalism removed from the promotion list for Armor, Helicopter, and all Water and Air units.
- Evasive Maneuvers requires the second tier Fighter/Bomber promotions.
- Operational Range requires the third tier Fighter/Bomber promotions.
- Logistics no longer lists Evasive Maneuvers or Operational Range as requisite promotions, but lists Aerial Bombardment III as one.
- Air Repair can now only be accessed through Logistics.
- Chemical Weapons nerfed to lose almost half of its combat bonuses.

**Unit Adjustments**
- Nuclear weapons can no longer be purchased.
- Terraformer Part production cost is doubled.
- Ancient Armor is now a standalone unit and its strength has been reduced to 55. This gives players a chance to fight back in the early-game against enemy factions who are allied with Almaty or have the Army Depot in their possession.
- Ancient Armor also gains some buffs, however: base movement increased to 5 with another point added when starting its turn in friendly territory, and no combat penalty for attacking across rivers.
- Attack Boats (and the Mariners' replacement) no longer require Factories to build, so they're now properly available at Steam Power instead of being forced to wait until Manufacturing. They can now also spawn as Barbarian units.
- Border Patrol no longer starts with Skirmish.
- Expeditionary Force no longer obsoletes.
- Great Caravan's uniques were corrected so it's still properly considered a Great Merchant.
- Machine Guns are now Shooter/Personnel units.
- Neutron Bomb's production cost reduced to 1000.
- Purge Robot Proto's strength increased to 40 and the Low Tech modifier is removed. This gives Hexlock a fighting chance in the early-game.
- Scouts (and New Star's First Aid units) now upgrade to Forward Observers instead of Gunmen, putting an end to a commonly abused strategy.
    - Camelot's Wayfarers have to wait until Plastics to upgrade to Commandos instead.
- Seastead Vessels now require Oil to build.
- Speculatores regains the Forward Observer's Reconnaissance I starting promotion and also gains double combat strength when attacking cities.
- Wandering Doctors and Mobile Clinics, along with New Star's First Aid and Armed Ambulance units, are given a fake "Support" unique that I may do more with in the future.
- Wasteland Patrol is now locked behind Expansionism's national wonder and its production cost is increased to 60.
- Camelot UUs: Wayfarers, Knights and Brownsteel Knights have had their Production cost increased by 20 each, Excalibur Knights by 30.
- Deseret UUs: Battleaxe of the Lord no longer has a tech requirement and is available as a starting unit.
- Hexlock UUs: Field Scientist is now a standalone unit with 120 production cost and gets 2 instant build charges.

**Wonder Adjustments**
- Wincon wonders, International Trade Center, and Manhattan Project can no longer have their production hurried.
- Children of Rust's unique wonder, the Longhouse, has been replaced with First Kiva, which retains the Longhouse's effects but also buffs the wonder by adding 40 more city HP and a free Pantheon belief (awarded upon founding their religion).
- Salvage Tank Depot's Production penalty is replaced with a Production bonus.
- World Wonders tied to Ancient Wonders:
    - Salvage Army Depot replaced with Restore Army Depot, which costs 5x more Production and awards an Ancient Armor instead of a Tank, but adds +4 Production instead of +1 to the Army Depot tile and adds +25% Production towards Armor units in the owning city.
    - Nuclear Waste Museum is now a National Wonder, addressing an issue where it could still be purchased if Excavate Nuclear Waste was built first. It also adds 10% Science and Culture to its city, along with an additional +1 Culture/+3 Science to the ancient wonder tile, adding incentive to build it.
    - Excavate Nuclear Waste is adjusted to be far less punishing: the Food malus to the ancient wonder tile is removed and replaced with +3 Production, and the Food malus from the world wonder itself is cut in half.
    - Ally with Isolationists is now a National Wonder due to the same issue as Nuclear Waste Museum and its cost is now appropriate for an early-game wonder. Furthermore, it adds an extra point of Water/Science and two points of Culture to the Isolated Island, along with two points of Happiness to the city that owns it.
    - Annex Isolationists buffed to provide an extra copy of Weapons and Slaves and +1 population to the owning city. The -1 Culture penalty to the Isolated Island was moved to the world wonder itself and increased to -2.
    - Distribute Soft Drinks and Fist of God have been removed from the game.
    - Open the Vault loses the free Great Sage due to the wonder bug; however, it adds +2 Science and an extra +1 Culture/Faith to the Vault of Records. The free Sage will be restored once the bug is fixed.
    - Produce Soft Drinks buffed to add +2 extra Culture/Happiness to the Soft Drinks Factory.
    - Salvage Graveyard buffed to +2 Production/Science to the Ship Graveyard tiles, 2 Oil and 2 free Patrol Boats.
    - The Last Paradise buffed to add +2 extra Culture and Happiness to the Oasis and +15% Water to the owning city, along with +1 each of Food, Water, Culture and Happiness to Artificial oases.
    - Turbine Hall buffed to add +2 Production/Water and +1 Science to the Hydroelectric Dam and +20% Production to the city that owns it.
    - Faust Project and Salvage Space Station no longer award free techs due to the bug involving World Wonders; they instead give +20% Science to the owning city and add extra yields to their respective Ancient Wonders (now +4 Science, +2 Production for both, with an additional +2 Culture for the latter) and an extra copy of Uranium for the former.
    - Pit of Sacrifice no longer awards a free Pantheon Belief because of that same bug; it instead kills 1 pop in the city and adds +25% Faith. This one will be reversed once the bug is fixed.
    - Mining Operation buffed to add an extra point of Production to the Mining Pit, along with +15% Production to the city owning the wonder.
- Public Broadcast's production cost increased to 500 (was previously a much, much too low 100) and it now requires every non-puppeted city you control to have a Broadcast Tower, not just the city it's built in.
- Broadcast Network's production cost adjusted to 500 base + 30 per owned city, and now requires every city to have a Television Studio, instead of only needing one in the city it's built in. It also only gives half as much Global Happiness.
- National College and Grand Monastery's base production cost reduced to 125 (were previously much, much too high, at 300/400 respectively).
- Medical Network now requires a Hospital in every city instead of a minimum of 4 cities and its base production cost is reduced to 125 (was previously 400, too high for its tech requirement) + scaling upward by 30 per owned city.
- Public Works Administration only awards one Golden Age now instead of a potential permanent Golden Age. (This was prior to a much more severe nerf in the base scenario replacing the Golden Ages with a pathetic +20 Culture per friendship declaration/defensive pact, which will NOT be incorporated.) It also loses its one measly Science point, but adds an extra Production point to all cities (that are connected to the capital). Its Production cost is reduced to 150 base + 30 per owned city.
- Heavy Equipment awards 2 free Workers and adds +3 Production to the owning city, and its Production cost is reduced to 150 base + 30 per owned city.
- Domestic Electrification's production cost reduced to 150 base + 30 per owned city (the original cost of 400 base + 50 per owned city was excessive to the point of obscenity).
- Media Center is now a normal building instead of a National Wonder and adds +2 Culture to Data tiles worked by the city.
- Fusion Reactor's cost has been reduced and its effects are drastically buffed: it now doubles the faction's Power supply and adds 25% Production to all cities.
- Homeland Defense Initiative now boosts production towards defensive buildings (Walls, etc.), reducing the time spent building them by 20%, and adds 15% more city strength from those buildings - gaining an effect that was removed from Castle Doctrine in the policy rebalance.
- Mobile Encampment adopts Rekmod Hungary's gimmick of being able to move the capital at will, once Munitions is researched.
- Naval War College now provides 4 Great Admiral points per turn.

**Building Adjustments**
- Congress variants providing a faction-wide Unhappiness reduction nerfed to 5%.
- All Council variants now cost a minimum of 100 Production.
- Defensive buildings are no longer all automatically unlocked by building Walls and must now be built in order: Hardened Defenses requires Defensive Emplacements, Battery and Bunker require Hardened Defenses, and Active Denial System requires Battery.
- Ranches now include Horses.
- Listening Post (and relevant replacements) nerfed to 25% GP generation with no extra bonus for Constitution factions.
- Monopoly building adjustments:
    - None of them penalize the city's Production any longer. However, they have a civ-wide limit of 2 and only one of the four can exist in a city.
    - Content Farms (and replacements) now unlock at Networking and require Data Centers instead of Broadcast Towers, and give +3 Science instead of +1 Culture.
        - Blackwarden's replacement gives +10% Water but no longer boosts city growth, and provides 3 Slaves instead of 1.
    - Electronics Production Lines reduce local Unhappiness in the owning city by 10%.
    - Machinery Production Lines boost the city's Production by 10%.
    - Publishing Houses give +2 Culture.
- Arcology Dome buffed to +250 City HP and +33% Water, but requires the city to be of size 20 or higher (or will once that base game bug is fixed).
- Carbon Capture no longer adds stats to Grassland tiles; it instead adds Food and Production to Tree plantations and consumes Power.
- Production building adjustments:
    - Stables (and replacements) nerfed to +1 Production per Horses tile, but the Food penalty is removed.
    - Blast Furnaces nerfed to +1 Production per Scrap/Metal tile, but the Food/Water penalties and Coal requirement are removed.
    - Aluminum Smelter no longer adds a Food/Water penalty to Aluminum tiles and restores the commented out +3 Production to the city, and also adds an Engineer slot.
    - Oil Refinery no longer adds a Food/Water penalty to Oil tiles and also adds an Engineer slot.
    - Oil Plant buffed to provide 2 Power (1 by default, 1 more if the faction hasn't run out of Oil) and remove the Food/Water penalty, and add an Engineer slot.
    - Plastics Factory buffed to add +1 Production to Plastics tiles and +2 Production to Oil tiles worked by the city.
- Culture building adjustments:
    - Broadcast Tower now gives 2 Culture, no Happiness, keeps its 25% boost to Culture, and costs 3 maintenance.
    - Television Studio now gives 2 Culture, 2 Happiness, and costs 2 maintenance.
    - Interpretative Center no longer gives Happiness and requires the city to own a National Wonder and be working a Settlement GI. However, it also adds 3 base Culture to compensate.
- Water building adjustments:
    - Market (and replacements) have a Merchant slot moved to Water Storage, but gain 1 Water in compensation (Gostiny Dvor gains 2 instead).
    - Water Plant gains a Merchant slot and +2 Water.
    - Greywater Treatment Plant loses the Production penalties, but also loses its single point of Food yield and one point of base Water yield.
    - Rainwater Purifier adds an additional +15% to the city's total Water yields, making it more useful than it originally was.
- Science building adjustments:
    - Libraries (and all base scenario replacements) no longer add Culture to Books tiles, but add +2 Science instead of +1 to those tiles. All faction replacements now keep this bonus instead of just the Ignis replacement.
    - Public Schools (and replacements) no longer add Culture, and count every 2 population for Science instead of every 3.
    - Data Center nerfed to +5 Science instead of +50% Science (Hexlock's Encoding Center gives +8 instead of +65%). It also loses the Culture bonus to Data/Encrypted Data tiles, but adds an extra point of Science to those tiles.
- Tidal Array adjusted to gate 2 units of power behind Geo Engineering, but add +1 Production to Artificial atolls and Floating Settlements worked by the city and +2 Production to oceanic Wind farms.
- Almaty CS UBs: Alma Air Base/Tank Depot now double production for their respective units.
- Defiance CS UBs:
    - Terra-Spire now awards a free Pale Veteran (their variant of the State Guard unit).
    - Lawkeeper Office now replaces the Town Hall and gives them +3 Happiness (+4 if they have Power), an extra Administrator slot, and more Production towards Personnel units, but it's no longer available at the start of the game.
- Camelot UBs:
    - Stone of Ages no longer awards a free Riding Arena and no longer generates Faith on its own. The player is now expected to search for tiles with the Horses resource to settle near.
    - Riding Arena adds +1 Culture to Horses.
    - The Round Table now boosts Production in all cities connected to the capital by 5% instead of adding 33% Production to the capital with Planned Economy and 5% Production towards all buildings in cities connected to the capital. Its bonuses to Water and Science require finishing the Monopoly/Rationalism trees, respectively.
- Deseret UBs:
    - Restored Temple of Zion buffed to +25% passive religious pressure; however it remains weaker than it was prior to the "nuclear option" update cutting religious pressure in half.
    - Bishop's Storehouse now adds +1 Food to Grain tiles on Desert.
    - Disciplinary Council adds +1 Faith/Happiness and +25% passive religious pressure to annexed cities, so there's now a reason to build it instead of the Listening Post in those cities.
    - Printing Press adds +2 Science.
    - General Conference counts Followers of the Majority Religion.
    - Quorum of the Twelve adds +2 Production to all Faith buildings instead of a percentage bonus towards building construction and adds 25% Faith to the capital, but has its production cost doubled.
    - Blue Castle Reactor's maintenance cost is reduced by 1.
- Harbinger UBs:
    - State Dacha also spawns a free Opolcheniye unit (newly added Militia replacement).
    - Census Chamber now adds an Administrator slot.
- Hexlock UBs:
    - Experiment on Survivors nerfed to lose the free Great Scientist (it now gives a Field Scientist instead). It also adds +2 pop to the capital instead of +1 to all cities. Also, it's only available in the capital, but this is mostly inconsequential.
    - Record Grid buffed by giving +1 Local Happiness while the faction has Power to offset their UA's malus and reducing its production cost to match that of the Library it replaces.
    - Stormfront Center and Overcouncil nerfed by increasing their production cost to 150 each.
- Ignis UBs:
    - Fuel Depot loses the Food/Water penalties and adds +2 Production to Oil tiles, but only adds +1 Production to the city itself while the faction has Power and loses half its Culture output. Like the Oil Refinery it replaces, it gains an Engineer slot.
    - Arena now adds an Administrator slot instead of +1 Happiness.
- Legion UBs: Colosseum buffed to +2 Happiness.
- New Star UBs: In accordance with the Mobile Encampment adjustment, Gideon Scanner and Rally Station are adjusted to be limited to 1, unbuildable if their opposite building is constructed, and unable to be purchased. Their production cost has also been increased to 150 each.
- Proklyatyye UBs: State Assembly and Politburo's production cost increased by 50 each.

**Belief Adjustments**
- The three pantheons that added Happiness to specific Natural tiles no longer do so.
- Follower beliefs that add +2 or higher Food yields are now exclusive from each other, as are Enhancer beliefs that add passive religious pressure.
- Annihilationism, Art of War, Atomic Judgment, Blessing of Peace, and New Zion are now locked behind Theocracy Complete.
- Atomic Judgment now only gives the Strength bonus to Nuclear Weapons.
- Atomic Children's Faith yields on Fallout/Toxic Waste reduced from 3 to 2.
- Blessing of Peace adjusted to +20% growth while at peace, +2 Food to Barracks.
- Faith Healers nerfed; healing for units adjacent to cities reduced to +10 HP and it's restricted to Personnel units for its unique promotion.
- God of Commerce adds +2 Water instead of +2 Science.
- Happiness in Faith altered to add +2 Production and +1 Culture/Happiness to Monasteries.
- Hymns of Praise moved to Pantheon and buffed to add +1 Water.
- Illuminated Order moved to Founder and its Faith discount on religious units moved to Missionary Zeal/Thought Control in a reduced amount (25% to each). Its new effect awards 50 Culture (modified by game speed) the first time each city converts to that religion.
- Itinerant Preachers, Primacy, and Religious Texts have been made inaccessible.
- New Zion buffed to award the player with a free Great Sage upon adopting the belief.
- Obey the Elders also adds +2 Food to cities with an active specialist.

- Works of Genius' Faith yields to Great Improvements cut in half and it now adds +1 Science/Faith to cities with an active Specialist.

**Policy Adjustments**
- The entire policy tree has been redone, borrowing mostly from Rekmod but making some deviations for the sake of lore + to keep it a bit more in line with a BNW-style expansion mod.

**Tile Improvement Adjustments**
- Artificial atolls no longer yield Happiness.
- Boroughs now provide +1 Science on Data/Electronics tiles and +1 Culture on Artifacts/Weapons tiles.
- Floating Settlements now yield Culture instead of Happiness for each adjacent Artificial atoll.
- Grasslands severely nerfed; they no longer yield Happiness and their adjacency bonuses from other natural tiles have been heavily curtailed.
- Outposts and Prison farms receive extra yields (+4 Production for the former atop strategic resources, +1 Production per adjacent Farm and +1 extra Food at Land Remediation for the latter) and provide 1 extra slave each.
- Refineries have their base yields increased by 1 and gain adjacency bonuses so they're not as utterly useless as they currently are in the base scenario. This is a temporary measure until the entire gimmick for Hexlock is redesigned.
- Research sites receive an extra +1 Science at Laboratory.
- Solar collectors and Wind farms provide 1 extra unit of Power if the player chooses Bionics as their ideology and adopts Weather Engineering, and gain +1 Production at Plastics and another +1 at Atmosphere Remediation (Wind farms on Ocean tiles gaining another +1 at Ocean Remediation).
- Solar collectors also have their construction time reduced to 10 turns (on Standard speed).
- Terrace farms receive extra food scaling (they now start at 2 base and add 1 with adjacent Farm or Grassland tiles) so they aren't obsoleted by Tree plantations being buildable on Hills.

**New Victory Conditions**
- Colonization Victory has been added, inspired somewhat by the "DeCiv in Alpha Frontier" fanfic-tier expansion mod for Alpha Frontier.
- The "proper" Domination Victory condition of only needing to capture all enemy capitals is also enabled.

**New City-States**
- The Pax, Research type, inspired by the Gene Roddenberry film *Genesis II*. If they spawn in the game, kiss the Cryo Sanctum wonder goodbye since it's awarded to them for free at the start.
- Hockeytown, Culture type.

**New Buildings and Wonders**
- Standalone:
    - Alternet Cafe, a Culture boosting building that consumes Power and grows stronger in larger cities (but not as strong as pre-nerf Public Schools)
    - Composite Materials Plant, which consumes Coal and Power to give a 10% boost to building construction in the owning city and add +1 Production to strategic resources, +2 Production to Manufactories (Note: this building has since been deleted)
    - Condenser Cooler, which consumes Coal to provide the owning city with more Water (10% total and +1 to worked Moisture traps), but obsoletes in the late-game
    - Sanctuary, a Happiness boosting building meant to encourage building Nature preserve improvements since it adds yields to those improvements (+1 Food/Water/Culture) but requires the city to be working at least 1
    - Sociopolitical Institute, a Culture boosting building that grows stronger with each social policy completed (starts at +2 Culture and +1 Administrator slot, gains +1 Culture per completed policy)
- Policy Specific:
    - Earth Clinic, locked behind Naturalism, boosting the city's Food/Culture yields and giving it access to part of the Faith Healers belief
    - Earthscraper Project, locked behind Collectivism, enabling construction of Earthscraper buildings which add 1 of every Specialist, +2 pop, a *lot* of city HP and make the city almost completely immune to pop loss from nukes.
    - Navy Shipyard, locked behind Rediscovery and requiring the player to finish the tree, boosting starting XP of naval units, giving those units a unique promotion, and adding +2 Production to Drydocks worked by the city along with +2 Great Admiral points per turn
    - Oceanological Center, locked behind Rediscovery, consuming Power and boosting Science/Happiness for coastal cities
    - Resettlement Bureau, locked behind Collectivism, converting 1 pop in the capital to a Civilian Convoy and adding a production boost to Civilian Convoys along with Food yields to Settlements (Note: this building has since been deleted)
    - Workers' Facility, locked behind Collectivism, provides a free Factory, boosts training speed of Civilian units by 25% and boosts the city's Science output by 10% but consumes Power, has high maintenance, and cannot be sold
- Faction/City-State Specific:
    - All City-States:
        - Defense Directorate, a defensive building to aid them against aggressive AI factions in the early-game, made in response to the latest update to DeCiv Redux enabling capital razing (Almaty, Hockeytown and Tellus get unique versions right away, other variants are planned later)

        - Alma Strategic Reserve, a standalone UB giving them more Oil so they can build more tanks
        - Central Press Service, a standalone UB giving them a unique luxury

        - Both the Thunderdome and Underworld will remain intact if Bartertown is captured
    - Calico CS:
        - Nanomaterial Factory, granting a new unique luxury and granting their units a unique promotion
    - Camelot Foundation:
        - Abbey, replacing the Monastery, adding +2 Water instead of costing maintenance

        - Sacred Cave, replacing the Shrine, adding +50 City HP, +1 Culture, and an additional +2 Culture/Faith to Ancient Wonders if the player is lucky enough to settle near one
    - The Harbingers:
        - Pogost, replacing the Town Hall, boosting the city's Water yields (+2 base increasing to +3 and +1 Faith/Culture/Happiness with sufficient Power, along with +1 Water per trade route, +2 Water to Wasteland Stations worked by the city, and a Merchant slot instead of an Administrator slot)
    - Hexlock:
        - Advanced Chemical Refinery, a standalone UB for Hexlock locked behind Supremacy that boosts Refinery yields by 50% and grants Chemical Weapons to Purge Robots trained in the city, but consumes both Coal and Power
    - Proklyatyye:
        - Kolkhoz, replacing the Greenhouse, adds +2 Production, 2 Farmer slots instead of 1, and +1 Production to active Farmers in the city, but has higher maintenance (2 vs. 1)

**New Units**
- Great Admirals are added in the form of their present Rekmod implementation. They use the "Is part of Great Person group" unique and do not increase the GPP cost of other Great People.
- State Guard, a unit exclusive to City-States made in response to a hated update to DeCiv Redux that temporarily allowed capital razing.
    - Unique versions (so far):
        - Almaty: Alma State Guard, with the same combat strength/promotions as NBC Infantry and a combat bonus in friendly territory
        - Defiance: Pale Veteran, with the same combat strength as Soldiers and starting with Gas Mask and Drone Recon
        - Hockeytown: Blueliner, which gains extra effectiveness in cold terrain
        - Tellus: Dendro Mutant, with the same stats as Gunmen instead of Militia, and can instantly build 2 Tree plantations
- Alma Frontier Guard and Alma Honor Guard, Almaty's new replacements for the Scout and Spearman.
- Exploratores, the Legion's replacement for the Scout with increased strength, starts with Sentry, can move after attacking, and has a chance to capture any Barbarians it picks off, but has a higher production cost.
- Opolcheniye, the Harbingers' replacement for the Militia that's weaker (32 vs. 36) but cheaper to both build (45 vs. 55) and buy, does not consume Weapons resources, and starts with Hazard Pay.

- Rapid Response Squad, New Star's replacement for the Forward Observer that starts with Medic I/II and Gas Mask, has extra strength when defending, and can instantly clear Fallout, but has a higher production cost.

- Acolytes of a New God, awarding 50 Faith each time a city is conquered
- Followers of Old World Crafts, adding +1 Water and Culture to Distillery and Jeweler buildings
- Great Commission, adding +1 Water/Faith to Harbors and Seaports. Shame the AI doesn't know to not pick this one when it's not controlling a coastal faction.

- Hopeful Habitability, locked behind Theocracy Complete, adding +1 Food/Faith to all natural tiles
- Humanitarian Missions, aka BNW's Charitable Missions except as a Founder belief instead of Reformation

- Unity of the Sages, adding 50% to the total yields of Seminaries, Oracles and Endowment Houses, and +2 Faith to all Faith buildings in cities with 10+ followers
- Veneration of the Elders, with the same effect as Devoted Elite in Rekmod

**New Resources**
- Advanced Fabrics, exclusive to the Calico CS and unlocked late in the game
- Newspaper, (currently) exclusive to the Almaty CS

**New Tile Improvements**
- Preservator, borrowed from Bamboolord's expansion mod with his permission, adjusted, and granted to The Pax CS. This GI gains yields from the finisher bonuses of Rationalism and Constitution (+4 Culture/Science during Golden Ages from the former, +2 Culture/Science from the latter)

#### November 2023 - April 2024

**Mod Compatibility**
- A few adjustments have been made for the sake of maintaining compatibility with Bamboolord's expansion mods, with further adjustments likely in the near future:

	- Monopoly's finisher bonus now adds +2 Food/Water to Banana Business Areas.
	- Ecodefense now extends its combat bonus to Jungle Replanting Zones.

		- Banana Business Areas give less Water to enemy factions who pillage them.
		- Landmarks start at +4 Culture, no longer add Happiness at Flight, and have the gained yields from Incentivization and Globalization swapped.
		- Additionally, Preservators now give Science instead of Water for pillaging.

**Mod Options**
- The increase to the XP cap from combat with Barbarians has been removed.
- The increase to survivor/barbarian camp spawn rate has been further reduced and is now only 2x higher than the base game.

**Ruins Adjustments**
- Units can no longer receive free upgrades from clearing a survivor or barbarian camp.
- The availability and strength of several bonuses have been adjusted:
	- Water bonuses have been reduced (100-150 on Standard speed for the first tier, 400-600 for the second).
	- The first tier Culture and Faith bonuses can no longer be obtained during the first 15 turns.
	- The second tier Faith bonus has been reduced back to 33% of the amount needed for a Great Sage.
	- The window to acquire a rare bonus Pantheon has been narrowed: it can no longer be obtained during the first 30 turns, and now exits the pool after 80 turns.
	- The two map tile reveal effects now exit the pool after 75 turns.
	- Great Generals/Farmers can no longer be acquired during the first 50 turns.
	- Bonus Social Policies can no longer be acquired during the first 50 turns, and exit the pool after 100 turns.
	- Infernal Training is now unavailable during the first 40 turns of the game (was previously the first 20).

	- Combat Armor promotions now have a higher weight and are buffed to grant the unit +10 XP, but are only available for Personnel units.
	- The healing bonus has been removed partly for being relatively lackluster compared to other bonuses, partly because it doesn't seem to function at all.

**Quest Adjustments**
- Clear Barbarian Camp has been made unavailable by increasing the minimum civ number past what is possible. (While this was mostly due to a bug where allowing barb camps to award ruins bonuses preventing everything else involving barb camps from triggering that has since been fixed, there was a second reason that's still somewhat valid, the City-States themselves being fully capable of clearing the quest before you can.)
- Contest Culture, Faith, and Technologies' duration reduced by 20%, now lasting 24 turns on Standard speed.
- All available quests are now weighted.

**Specialist Adjustments**
- Administrators adjusted to +3 Culture (which is where they should be).

**Tech Adjustments**
- Radar now has Electronics as an additional prerequisite tech, preventing players from skipping an entire technological era.
- Computers now has Electronics as an additional prerequisite tech and no longer increases Production or Science.
- Biology no longer increases city growth.
- Nuclear Fission renamed to Nuclear Power.

**Faction Adjustments**
- Atlas heavily nerfed:
	- They now have to wait until Education to get their free Great Scientist.
	- They no longer receive a bonus towards generating GP types other than Scientists, which is set at 30% due to being allowed to keep Rationalism adopted at the start.
	- They no longer start with any free techs aside from Electronics.
	- They no longer have a nonsensical (and frankly unnecessary) double Production speed bonus towards their unique Electrostatic Generators.
	- However, the early-game Science penalty has also been removed.
	- They also receive one buff: all of their non-Mounted, non-Ranged Personnel units inherit the Surveyor's ability to build tile improvements regardless of whether or not they upgraded from a Surveyor.
- Children of Rust nerfed; the Faith bonus only applies as long as the Ruins tiles are unimproved, and they no longer start with Redomestication.
- Crimson Legion buffed:
	- They now start with Iron Working instead of Redomestication.
	- Low Tech units receive a 20% strength bonus when attacking.
- Cult of Ignis nerfed again; they no longer get extra Faith from strategic resource tiles.
- New Afrika nerfed; the Great Wall effect in their UA now has an expiration date, and they no longer start with Redomestication. However, their combat bonus against larger civs no longer has a policy requirement.
- The Patriots' UA has been reworked a bit:
	- They now start with Munitions instead of any of their original four free techs.
	- They no longer have an early-game Science penalty.
	- Citadels gain +2 Production/Science, increasing to +4 after entering the Industrial era.

**City-State Adjustments**
- Almaty's "declaring war" line has been edited again. The CS itself might get a rename in the future, with more dialogue changes to accompany it.
- Defiance, which was intentionally overpowered on introduction, has been harshly nerfed:
	- The number of free techs is reduced to two - Mining and Machinery, instead of any of their original five.
	- They are still locked out of Low Tech units like Almaty.
	- The Production bonus towards Personnel units in the UA is reduced from 66% to 25%.
	- The free AI Implant promotion for all Personnel units has been moved to the Von Bach Industries UB.
	- However, they also produce 25% more strategic resources.
- Devil's Canyon now starts with Electronics instead of Rifling.
- Issaquah Nation buffed; they now also start with Iron Working.
- Order of Jerome starts with Secrets of the Past and Education instead of Electronics.
- Tellus now has a Wasteland start bias and has been nerfed: the absurd combat bonuses when fighting on or near Tree plantations have been severely reduced (and condensed into a new unique promotion).
- Venice Beach's attacked/defeated dialogue was altered so it's no longer copied verbatim from Civ 5 Venice.

**Building Adjustments**
- Government:
	- Congress variants:
		- Camelot Foundation's Round Table is adjusted as follows:
			- Gaining the standard Council +10% growth bonus.
			- Removing the policy requirement on the Production bonus.
			- Removing the percentage Science yield in the capital after completing Rationalism.
			- Changing the percentage Water yield from +33% in the capital after completing Monopoly to +10% in all cities connected to the capital without a policy requirement.

		- Deadrock Clan's Smugglers' Guild now adds +3 Water/Culture to worked Narcotics farms and +2 Water/Culture to Casinos.
		- The Mariners' Trader's Congress no longer increases Influence gain from Water gifts to City-States; instead it adds scaling Water yields (+1 per 4 population) to all cities, +1 Water to city connections, and grants Culture equal to 10% of the total Culture output of allied City-States.
		- New Afrika's Survival Program now adds scaling Culture yields (+1 per 4 population) instead of a flat +2 Culture to all cities.
		- Politburo's State Assembly also adds scaling Production yields and now counts every 4 population instead of every 5.

		- Atlas's Think Tank buffed to give a +25% Production boost towards Science buildings and a +15% Production boost to cities other than the capital when they construct buildings owned by the capital.
		- Blackwarden's Board of Directors now adds +2 Water/Science to Personnel Offices and allows Military units to farm Water in combat equal to 10% of the damage they deal to enemy Military units.
		- Children of Rust's Defense Committee nerfed to reduce the Production bonus towards Military units to 10% and restrict it to Land units. However, it does gain the standard 10% Council growth boost.
		- Commonwealth's Embassy no longer boosts GP generation, but instead makes Water gifts to City-States yield 25% more influence, and it gains the standard Council bonuses.
		- Crimson Legion's Consulate now doubles the recovery rate of lost CS influence. This is a placeholder buff until Gunboat Diplomacy is added to Unciv.
		- Cult of Ignis's Seer Council's old effects have been thrown out; it now adds +2 Culture to every Fuel Depot and College of Mystics along with a +25% Production bonus towards Faith buildings and the standard 10% city growth boost.
		- Deadrock Clan's Grand Clan Manor now costs 100 Production (down from 200) but only gives 15 XP to newly trained units. However, it grants a +10% Production boost towards Personnel units and boosts city growth by 10% like most Council variants.
		- Deseret Nation's Quorum of the Twelve now adds +2 Science/Culture to all worked Great Improvements and excludes itself from its Production bonus (it's now applied to the three regular Faith buildings + Worship Belief buildings). It no longer allows Production to Faith conversion, and receives the standard 10% city growth boost.
		- The Mariners' Raider's Council now gives a +15% Production boost towards naval units and the standard Council +10% growth boost, but only to coastal cities.
		- New Afrika's Revolutionary Council now gives a +15% Production boost towards Personnel units.
		- Proklyatyye's Politburo no longer adds Culture/Happiness to Gulags; it instead adds +3 Production to them, and the Production bonus to Corrective Colonies and Listening Posts is increased to +3.
- Food/Growth:
	- Greenhouse (and replacements) and Hydroponic Farming buildings now gain +1 Food if the player gets access to Exotic Seeds.
	- Protected Area now requires the city to be working a Tree plantation improvement, but no longer adds Water penalties to Tree plantations.
	- Hospitals (and replacements) no longer gain +1 Food from having Harvested Organs.
		- The remaining "evil" faction replacements no longer have reduced food preservation compared to the standard Hospital.
- Industry:
	- For balance reasons, the three main Power Plants (Coal, Oil, Nuclear) are no longer accessible to City-States (aside from the unique Nuclear Plant for Devil's Canyon).
	- Buildings that require specific non-Power resources no longer add Engineer slots.
	- Bio Synthesizer has been moved to Plastics Recycling and now provides 2 copies of Oil, but no Aluminum or Uranium. You can now have up to 5 instead of 3.
	- Carbon Capture nerfed; it no longer provides Food at all (I thought I'd made this change earlier, but apparently not) and costs 3 maintenance instead of 2.
	- Composite Materials Plant has been deleted on account of it becoming redundant after reworks to other buildings.
	- Forge (and its replacements) no longer has a resource requirement and gains an Engineer slot, but no longer gains benefits from having Machine Parts.
		- Children of Rust's version also no longer adds Production to Scrap resources, though it regains the normal Forge's bonus to Land unit production.
		- Deadrock Clan's version has been removed from the game.
		- Proklyatyye's version no longer adds Water penalties to worked Uranium tiles.
	- Heat Plant moved to Plastics and now provides 4 units of Power.
	- Metal Reprocessor's Production cost increased to 1000, but it now provides 2 copies of Aluminum.
	- Nuclear Plant now provides 16 units of Power but cannot be built if the city owns an Oil Plant. Deseret, Devil's Canyon and Proklyatyye's versions have been adjusted accordingly.
		- Proklyatyye's Atomic Pile starts at 8 units of Power and scales to 16 with techs.
	- Oil Plant now provides up to 8 units of Power, scaling with techs + resource availability. However, it no longer increases Production.
	- Oil Refinery now provides a second copy of Oil after researching Advanced Materials.
	- Plastics Factory now adds +5% to the city's total Production.
	- Plastics Reprocessor has been removed from the game.
	- Prison Camps and their replacements are now 3x more expensive to build. The cost of purchase is increased further (except for factions that outlaw slavery).
		- The standard camps and Commonwealth's Black Site no longer penalize the annexed city's Food supply.
		- Processing Centers have their Food penalty reduced from 25% to 10%.
		- Corrective Colonies lose the flat -2 Food penalty (but keep the percentage Food penalty).
	- Recycling Plant is now a Production building instead of a Power building, adding +1 Production to Scrap/Metal/Plastic and Strategic resource tiles, +15% to the city's total Production output, and 1 Engineer slot, but does not provide resources and consumes Power to build.
	- Transport Network *severely* nerfed; it now only adds +1 Production to Boroughs and no other stats.
		- Childen of Rust's Bike Path is now a standalone Culture building instead of a Production building and is available at Railroads; it adds +1 Culture to Rubble/Ruins tiles that are up to 2 tiles away from the city center.
	- Uranium Centrifuge's Production cost increased to 1000 and its restrictions are tightened; you can now only have 3 and they must be in cities with a Nuclear Plant.
	- Work Camp nerfed; the percentage Production bonus is reduced to 10%, the Engineer slot and extra Production bonuses with surplus Slaves are removed, and it inflicts +2 Unhappiness on cities that build it. This also applies to the two Russian faction replacements.
		- Gulag (Proklyatyye) no longer has a percentage Production bonus at all.
- Military:
	- Armament/Armor Production Lines and Aerospace Facilities no longer have negative modifiers to the owning city's Production. However, they now have a maintenance cost of 3 Water.
	- Armor Production Line is overall nerfed; its Production bonus towards Armor units is reduced to 33% (and turns off when Power is lost) and it no longer awards a free Tank. To compensate, building it unlocks access to a new promotion for Armor units, which is given for free to newly-trained Armor units in that city.
	- Armory is no longer a defensive building; its boost to City Strength has been removed.
	- Defense Directorate and its variants have been adjusted quite a bit:
		- They are now exclusive to the city-states' original city, just in case issues crop up in the (not as rare as it should be) case where a city-state captures another city-state or a faction's capital or holy city.
		- They no longer increase the City-State's unit supply.
		- They only allow 3 units to be maintenance free (down from 5; Almaty and Tellus retain the original amount).
		- They no longer increase the City-State's city strength.
		- They only add +50 City HP (down from 80); Almaty's version instead adds 80 (down from 100).
		- They no longer provide free units each time the City-State goes to war.
		- They only provide one free State Guard, along with two free copies of a new and purely defensive unit (except for Issaquah which keeps the Hawkman Braves).
	- Several other defensive buildings have been nerfed:
		- Walls provides +50 HP (down from 80).
		- Coastal Defenses provides +50 HP (down from 80).
		- Choke Points provides +50 HP (down from 80).

		- Bunker provides +100 HP (down from 200).
		- Earthscraper provides +120 HP (down from 500).
		- Arcology Dome provides +150 HP (down from 250).
		- Enclavers' Scrounged Armory and Guerrilla Camp are no longer defensive buildings.
		- Hexlock's Field Turret provides +10 City Strength (down from +25).
- Science and Culture:
	- Museum no longer adds Faith, but adds +1 Culture/Science to worked Artifacts tiles and +10% to the city's total Culture output.
	- Jeweler no longer adds a Merchant slot (it adds +2 Water/Culture instead).
	- University slightly buffed; it now adds an extra +2 Science instead of +1 when the owner has access to Power.
	- The three base game faction variants no longer senselessly have reduced Science compared to the standard University, but also no longer give Great Person Points. They are further adjusted as follows:
		- Crimson Legion: College of Rhetoric now adds +2 Happiness and gives a Scientist slot instead of an Administrator slot, but does not add Culture.
		- Cult of Ignis: College of Mystics now adds an unconditional +2 Culture, along with +1 Faith when they have access to Power.
		- Deadrock Clan: Trade College now adds +2 Water and no longer has a maintenance cost, but does not add Culture or a Merchant slot.
	- Interpretative Center no longer adds an Administrator slot, but also loses the National Wonder requirement.
	- Media Center can now be built with worked Books tiles and adds +2 Culture to those tiles, but no longer adds Great Administrator points.
	- Decryption Center now consumes Power in addition to Encrypted Data and adds +2 Science instead of +1 Culture.
- Other faction/CS-specific buildings:
	- All City-States:
		- Their Monument replacements are now standalone buildings, no longer provide extra Food/population/units (with a few exceptions for the Food/units), but are still destroyed when the CS is captured.
	- Almaty:
		- Alma Air Base only gives one free Salvaged Helicopter again and no longer increases city HP. But it also gives a free Salvaged Bomber.
		- Alma Tank Depot no longer increases city strength and the free Ancient Armor is now awarded at Machinery.
			- Neither of the above buildings provide any resources or flat Production/Science yields anymore.
			- The production bonus to their respective units is reduced to 20%.
			- However, they are also no longer mutually exclusive (unless, of course, Almaty is settled on a Hill).
			- Also, the Air Base will give Almaty a free Salvaged Bomber once they discover Steel along with extending its production bonus to aircraft.
		- Alma Base no longer increases the city's defenses on its own, but it makes Almaty's other defensive buildings 25% more effective and adds +3 Production, +2 Science.
		- Alma Oil Depot is now a standalone building (so there is a chance of keeping it intact on capture), adds +3 Production, but does not add Culture, Happiness or Engineer slots.
		- Alma Strategic Reserve is now restricted to Almaty's original city and cannot be built in any other CS or capitals they capture.
		- Central Press Service now adds +2 Local Happiness.
	- The Archive:
		- Archive of the Arts gives 2 less Culture and 1 less Great Administrator point.
		- Encyclopedia now gives +2 Culture/Science (formerly +3 Culture).
	- Arroyo:
		- Their identity building is now named "Arroyo Ritual Grounds" and the Culture it provides is reduced from 10 to 3. It now gives a +25% Production bonus towards Low Tech units.
	- Atlas:
		- Kruger Line now adds +3 Culture to the capital, but only adds +1 Production to Railroads and +1 Water per Trade Route. Its cost is greatly reduced, to 150 + 30 per owned city (was originally 625).
	- Blackwarden:
		- Personnel Office regains its commented out Merchant slot, gains an Administrator slot, and adds a +10% Production bonus towards Personnel units along with a 25% cost reduction in tile purchases. However, its Production cost is increased to 160 and it no longer gains bonuses from having Slaves.
		- Resource Management Server no longer provides Slaves.
		- These two changes mean that Blackwarden is no longer a Slaver faction.
	- Camelot Foundation:
		- Sangreal Vault is now an unconditional +2 Science and adds +1 Culture/Faith with access to Artifacts.
		- Riding Arena adjusted to +2 Culture/Happiness.
		- Constabulary's maintenance cost reduced to 1.
		- Parish School now adds +2 Science/Faith.
	- Children of Rust:
		- Commune now adds +2 Food with access to Power and regains the standard Town Hall's Administrator slot, but no longer has any base yields and no longer reduces tile purchase costs. It now unlocks at Civil Service and costs 120 Production.
	- Crimson Legion:
		- Two UBs have been eliminated: the Slaver Guild and Tribal Unification Initiative.
		- Legion Camp now replaces Barracks and no longer inflicts a Food penalty, but also no longer strengthens the city's defenses or spawns free units.
		- Victory Column buffed to gain +1 base Local Happiness (so it now provides +2 during wartime).
		- Crucifixion Fields now replace Prison Camps and are no longer built automatically. They no longer inflict a Food penalty (I thought I'd made this adjustment earlier, but apparently not) and like standard Prison Camps will be destroyed if the city is captured. They remain unsellable, however.
		- Slave Markets no longer add a Food bonus.
		- Colosseums no longer add an extra point of Culture or Happiness from having excess Slaves. Also, they are now unsellable.
		- Caesareums no longer add base Production yields, but in exchange have the Production bonus towards buildings increased to 10%.

	- Cult of Ignis:
		- Plantation now belongs to Deadrock Clan as a Greenhouse replacement.
		- Arena no longer adds an Administrator slot or extra Culture/Happiness with surplus Slaves; instead it adds +1 Happiness while at war. Also, the extra starting XP is now restricted to Armor units.
	- Deadrock Clan:
		- Plantation now unlocks at Botany like standard Greenhouses, costs 70 Production, and no longer adds a percentage boost to total Food yields. Instead, it adds +1 Food to active Farmers in the city and +1 Culture to Narcotics farms (along with the standard Greenhouse effect).
		- Clubhouse now generates 2 Water per turn and no longer costs maintenance.
		- Organ Farm now consumes Power in addition to consuming Slaves.
	- Defiance:
		- Terra-Spire renamed to Gateway Arch (as in the St. Louis Gateway Arch).
		- Lawkeeper Office's bonus to Personnel unit training speed removed.
		- Von Bach Industries no longer gives a free Armory (this is now unnecessary thanks to other adjustments).
	- Deseret Nation:
		- Bishop's Storehouse no longer adds extra Culture/Faith from having access to Books.
		- Sacred Cave now has the City Defense modifier.
		- Disciplinary Council's maintenance cost reduced to 1.
	- Fo Guang:
		- Fo Guang Library has been removed from the game. Considering the actual Fo Guang Shan IRL has established and continues to operate libraries, universities (secular ones, even) and public schools, it made absolutely ZERO sense for them to be unable to build a library post-Cataclysm and thus be locked out of the other science buildings.
	- Ghost Mountain:
		- Their identity building is now named "Ghost Mountain Reserve," the amount of Culture it provides is reduced from 10 to 2, and it no longer gives Happiness. It now adds +1 Food to every Food source worked by the city.
	- The Harbingers:
		- Gostiny Dvor now has the City Defense modifier.
		- Pogost swaps its Merchant slot for an Administrator slot.
		- Census Chamber loses its Administrator slot and regains the normal Listening Post's +1 Happiness.
	- Hexlock:
		- Compound Mixers now replace Distilleries, while Chemical Extractors are standalone buildings. The latter receives the Engineer slot that was on the former, loses the Culture penalty, and gains +2 Production.
		- Record Grids are now unsellable and add +1 Science to worked Refineries.
		- Private Labels no longer add Science to worked Refineries (that yield was moved to Record Grid). However, the base Water yield on the building itself is increased to +2.
		- Pre-Med Labs now add +1 Food to worked VX Refineries, increasing to +2 at Pharmaceuticals.
		- Gas Field's stats adjusted to +2 Science, +1 Production, -1 Food for Tree plantations (was +4 Science, -1 Food/Water) and +2 Science, +1 Production in the city with access to Exotic Seeds (was +1 Science/Production).
		- Advanced Chemical Refinery is much harder to unlock: you have to build the Chemical Weapons Laboratory first.
	- Hockeytown:
		- Ice Hockey Rink no longer provides the Alcohol luxury.
	- The Hub:
		- Hub Monument is now Hub Trading Company, adding +5 Water to the city's base yields and +2 to each worked Moisture trap and Water pump.
		- Trader's Hub is now Hub Downtown but is otherwise unaltered.
		- Hub Work Camp is now Hub Underground, nerfed to match the standard Work Camp's nerfs, and will now be destroyed when the city is captured.
	- Jericho:
		- Homestead now only gives +2 Culture (was originally +5), but also gives +2 Water.
	- New Afrika:
		- Mosque has been temporarily removed from the game on account of it being inaccurate to their religion. When the building is reintroduced, it will be given to a new faction.
	- New Star:
		- Triage now costs 40 Production.
		- Emergency Response Network no longer adds an Administrator slot.
	- Order of Jerome:
		- The Abbey now gives 2 less Faith, no Culture, 1 less Science, and 1 less Great Scientist point.
		- Divine Knowledge now gives a free State Guard (or their new replacement for it, rather).
	- Proklyatyye:
		- Zemlyanka now has the City Defense fake unique and it adds +1 City Strength and +1 Food to Tundra Camps and Tundra Tubers to help offset the double whammy of their growth penalties and Tundra start bias. However, its increase to City HP is reduced from 50 to 20.

**Wonder Adjustments**
- All of the base scenario factions' starting wonders now have a base production cost of 0. They have also received further adjustments as detailed below:
	- Ark One's increase to City Strength reduced from 10 to 5.
	- Atlas Refuge nerfed to remove the Scientist slot; it receives +1 base Science, +5 City Strength and an additional +20 City HP in compensation.
	- Clan Hideout now gives Deadrock Clan's capital +2 Water and +50 HP.
	- Eagle Rock Complex harshly nerfed; it loses its Engineer slot and only adds +5 City Strength instead of the ridiculous +20 in the base scenario, but it receives +1 base Production to compensate.
	- First Kiva no longer gives Faith until a Pantheon has been founded, and gives a Food Store instead of a Salvage Yard since they were gaining too much early Production.
	- Forum corrected to a 5% Unhappiness reduction (was still 10%) and no longer increases City HP, but it now adds +1 Water and awards 2 free Swordsmen instead of 1.
	- The Great Lighthouse now gives The Mariners's capital +2 Food if it's founded on a coastline, but no longer gives Faith.
	- Great Mosque has been temporarily removed from the game for the same reason as the normal Mosque.
	- Hex Corporation only spawns 1 free Purge Robot Proto instead of 2. To compensate, it also gives a 10% Production bonus towards all Promotion Nullifier units after researching Replaceable Parts. Additionally, its boost to City HP is removed it no longer gives a free Compound Mixer (it now gives a free Food Store, which is a huge nerf).
	- On the run now spawns 2 Wandering Doctor replacements instead of a Militia.
	- Peace Memorial no longer gives Faith. Instead, the +1 Local Happiness is given to all cities during peacetime.
	- Restored Temple of Zion now spawns the 2 free Battleaxe of the Lord units, at the cost of losing the late-game Culture boost. This was because the previous setup put Deseret at a significant early-game disadvantage and made them the undisputed worst faction on Marathon speed. Also, the amount of Faith generated by the wonder per turn is reduced to 1.
	- Sarcophagus buffed to +2 Production.
	- State Dacha no longer gives a free Food Store.
	- Stockpile slightly buffed, adding +2 Food instead of +1.
	- Stone of Ages now has its quote.
	- Temple nerfed further to remove its base Faith yields and Administrator slot. To compensate, it adds +1 Culture/Faith to all active Administrators, but requires Engineering to unlock this boost.
- Many of the world and national wonders that require specific ancient wonders have been extended to a 5 tile range, though there are several that still need the ancient wonder to be within 3 tiles.
- Annex Isolationists now adds +5 Production instead of +5 Water to the Isolated Island.
- Biosphere Project's Production cost reduced to 750.
- Convert Survivors and Resettlement Bureau have been deleted.
- Domestic Electrification now adds +1 Culture/Happiness to all cities connected to the capital instead of a potential +8 Happiness in the capital. Its Production cost no longer scales according to how many cities the faction owns.
- Fusion Reactor now requires the capital to own a Nuclear Plant, but is buffed to add an additional +8 Production to the capital and all cities connected to it.
- Ground Control Center's Production cost reduced to 300 and it gives +3 Culture instead of Happiness. Adjustments to faction-specific replacements:
	- Atlas (Survey Center): Starts at +3 Science/+1 Culture, gains +5 Science/+2 Culture at Flight
	- Blackwarden (Operations Center): 150 base Production
	- Deseret (Deseret Data Center): 250 base Production, gains bonus for Automated units
	- The Patriots (Tactics Center): 100 base Production, moved to Munitions
- International Trade Center buffed to +5 base Water, +50% total Water yields for the owning city, and +3 Water from Trade Routes, adding more incentive to build it in the endgame. It also triggers an additional alert upon completion.
- Nuclear Waste Museum slightly buffed, increasing the added Culture to the Nuclear Waste Storage tile to +3.
- Organ Lab no longer provides Harvested Organs, and instead adds +2 Food, +1 Happiness to every Hospital. This effectively means Harvested Organs become exclusive to Deadrock Clan, at least for the time being.
- Produce Soft Drinks nerfed slightly, removing the additional +2 Happiness added to the Soft Drinks Factory.
- Propagate Seeds now costs 250 Production (up from 50) but boosts growth in all cities by 10% and adds +1 each of Food/Science/Culture to the Seed Vault.
- Salvage Bomber/Helicopter/Tank Depot now cost 125 Production (up from 75, or 60 in Bomber's case). The latter two now add +3 Production to the city instead of reducing Production by that amount.
- Shake Down Survivors now costs 30 Production, but awards 4 Slaves and a Gangboss.
- Statue of Remembrance now has its flavor text/quote.

**Unit Adjustments**
- All three non-drone Bomber units have had their ranged strength reduced by 5 (and in the case of Stealth Bombers, their strength reduced by 15).
- Ancient Armor's strength further reduced to 50 and its Production cost increased to 150.
- Ark Hunter and Mounted Railgun's Production costs increased to 150 each.
- Auxiliary is now a Crimson Legion UU, replacing the Militia as a weaker Low Tech version that retains infrastructure building abilities and gets a combat bonus when adjacent to other Melee units instead of against Mounted units. Also, it's no longer an Enslaved unit.
	- Consequently, Rubble Gangs are now a standalone unit for Deadrock Clan.
- Bartertown Security Force renamed (or rather, had its name corrected) to Bartertown Imperial Guard.
- Battle-axe of the Lord now has 28 strength (was previously 27).
- Biker (Barbarian unit) now replaces Horseman instead of Scout and is no longer considered a Mounted unit.
- Black Ops (and Camelot SAS) have had their ranged and defense strength increased by 20, but their Production cost was also increased by 50.
- Brownsteel Knight's Production cost reduced by 10; the initial cost increase of 20 from standard Hussars was too high considering the difference in strength between the two isn't that great.
- Civilian Convoys (and TCC's replacement) can no longer found cities on Fissures.
- Clansmen no longer require Clubhouses to be built, due to the building being available two tech eras later.
- Commandos now obsolete at Energy Weapons (since unlike normal Black Ops who consume 2 Weapons, Camelot SAS only consumes 1 so there's no point in letting Commandos remain trainable in the endgame).
- Crimson Legion UUs:
	- Swordsmen buffed to 24 combat strength and receive bonuses against Barbarians and when defending from Ranged units. They also generate 1 Culture per turn while garrisoned after the first Colosseum is built.
	- Legions buffed to 36 combat strength but no longer receive bonuses against cities.
	- Both upgrade to Soldiers instead of Militia.
- Destroying Angel no longer obsoletes and gets the same +5 defense/ranged strength buff as NBC Infantry.
- Drifter now has to embark and disembark as normal but gets double movement in Coast and Ocean tiles, and gets the same AI-only ability to construct non-instant water tile improvements as Work Boats.
- Drop Troops buffed to 55 strength.
- Exo-Troopers (and Proklyatyye's Super Mutants) have had their strength increased by 20 and gain a 25% bonus against Armor units, but their Production cost was also increased by 50.
- Field Scientists reverted to 70 production cost, 1 charge, but remain standalone units.
- First Aid units no longer have a 1-in-3 chance to capture Barbarians.
- Forward Observers and their replacements (with the exception of the Legion's Speculatores) can no longer capture cities. They now play the "shot" attack sound in combat.
- Great Farmers now add +2 population to the city they're in instead of +1 to all cities with their secondary ability (and they must be inside a city to activate that ability).
- Great Merchants no longer create Settlements, but an entirely new Great Improvement.
- Hexlock's Purge Robots are now standalone units.
	- Proto and MKI are now Armor units. The former's Production cost is increased to 75.
	- MKI and MKII require Aluminum instead of their previous secondary strategic resource (Weapons for MKI, Oil for MKII).

- Machine Guns now start with Logistics and gain a bonus when attacking Scrapper and Shooter units.
- Mechanized Workers can now enter impassable tiles and terraform tiles, receiving 2 charges.

- NBC Infantry/Marksman (and their replacements) have had their strength (and ranged strength for Marksman) increased by 5.
- Persevering Pax Researchers are no longer Great People. No more will City-State quests ask you to somehow acquire them.

- Salvaged Helicopter's movement points reduced by 1 and ranged strength reduced by 15. However, its Production cost is reduced by 50.

	- Alma State Guard's strength reduced to 40 and it now upgrades to Infantry instead of Exo-Troopers.

	- The Mariners' Jet Boat buffed to 25 melee strength, 45 ranged strength.
- Tree Lovers now cost 50 Production instead of 70, but only Tree plantations benefit from reduced construction time.
- Wandering Doctors buffed to 24 combat strength.
- Work Boats now have the ability to build all of the additional ocean tile improvements, but *only* for AI players. Human players still have to use Seastead Vessels for this.

**Belief Adjustments**
- Acolytes of a New God now awards +100 Faith (modified by game speed) for each city conquered.
- Ancestor Worship now adds +2 Culture to Shrines, does not add Faith to Monuments (matching Lekmod's adjustment), and no longer adds any stats to the Vault of Records.

- Feast of Flesh now adds +2 Food, +1 Happiness to Ranches, and cannot be taken alongside the other Follower Beliefs that add Food yields of +2 or higher (not counting Gardens).

- New Zion nerfed to restrict its stat yields to Seminaries + replacements and no longer spawn a free Great Sage for the first adopter.
- Religious Troubadours, Religious Unity, and The Radiant City are now inaccessible if the player adopts Exodus of the Evangelists before enhancing their religion, putting a stop to players abusing the bonus belief to take two of the three at the same time. This was the only way to do so until Reformation Beliefs are a proper belief type. Troubadours is also nerfed slightly, reducing the added Faith yields to city connections to +2.
- Sacred Sites now adds +2 Faith to Worship Centers (Cathedral, Divinity School, Dojo, Garden, Holy Fortress, Pyramid).
- Strength of the Earth no longer adds Production, the added Faith to Manufactories is reverted to its original +1, and the Mining Pit is no longer affected by this belief at all.
- Unity of the Sages' old effect has been thrown out; it's now Rekmod's Unity of the Prophets (+4 Faith, +2 Production to Seminaries + replacements) instead of Simultaneum from Civ 6.

	- Centralization's Production bonus to building construction in the capital buffed to 15%.

	- The finisher bonus no longer requires a garrison for the bonus Food/Growth.
- Sovereignty:
	- The opener bonus now allows an additional 4 units to be maintenance free.

	- Autocracy renamed to Security Forces and it now removes the maintenance cost of garrisoned units.
	- Military Tradition no longer grants its XP bonus to Aircraft.
- Theocracy:
	- Divine Mandate now lowers the Faith cost of unit/building purchase (instead of waiting until the finisher bonus).
	- The free Great Sage from Apotheosis has been moved to the finisher bonus after testing demonstrated that placing it here made it available much too early (allowing factions to consistently found a religion in the first 20 turns of the game). Apotheosis instead awards a free Golden Age and keeps the policy cost reduction effect.
	- Exodus of the Evangelists' added Faith yields to the Grand Monastery reduced to a fixed +4. The bonus belief from the finisher bonus has been moved here. Additionally, it no longer requires Indulgences, but still requires Organized Religion.
	- The finisher bonus reduces the added Faith yields to Seminaries and their replacements to +1, and increases the added Culture yields to +3.

	- Legislative Process no longer adds any boosts to GP generation. However, it now also adds Culture to the Council.
	- The finisher bonus has been moved to the new Legacy ideology. Constitution Complete now adds +2 Science/Culture to all Great Improvements.
- Supremacy:
	- The opener bonus now extends its Production bonus to Armories.
	- Police State now cuts the construction time of Prison Camps and Work Camps in half.
	- The finisher bonus is reduced to a 15% combat bonus, but remains in effect for the entire game once adopted. The +2 Food bonus to all cities from possessing Slaves is removed and replaced with +1 Culture with the same condition. With the adjustments to Crystal Refinery yields, it now adds +4 Science to them instead of +2 Water/Science.
- Monopoly:
	- Increased priority for AI factions that prefer Diplomatic Victory.
	- The opener now adds +1 Culture to Markets and increases the bonus to Great Merchant generation by 33%.
	- Mass Consumption now adds +1 Gold to all Refineries.
	- Enterpreneurship nerfed to 25% maintenance cost reduction on infrastructure.
	- The finisher bonus now adds +2 Culture to Narcotics farms and +4 Water instead of +2 to each boosted Great Improvement except for Wasteland Stations, but no longer adds yields to Settlements (since Great Merchants no longer create them). Also, it awards a free Great Merchant.

	- The opener now increases the bonus to Great Engineer generation by 33% and unlocks access to a new unit.

	- Physiolatry no longer adds Food/Production to its four buildings. It adds +1 Happiness instead.
	- Ecodefense now unlocks access to a new unit and awards three of them for free.
	- Harmony's effects have been moved to a new ideology. It now receives the Faith bonuses that were removed from the Bionics ideology (Discount on Faith purchases, +2 Faith in cities with 2 or more specialists) along with +25% Culture in cities with a Protected Area.
	- Conservation now adds 10% to the total Water yields of cities with a Rainwater Purifier instead of a flat +2 to that building.
- Mechanization:
	- Increased priority for AI factions that prefer Domination Victory.
	- The opener is nerfed to a flat +2 Production, but also adds +2 Happiness to all cities.
	- Urbanization no longer increases Science.
	- Automation no longer gives Happiness.
	- Digitization adjusted to +2 Culture/Happiness and no Faith for Data/Decryption Centers.
	- The finisher no longer gives a free Purge Robot (this was very...unbalanced) and now gives two free Great People like the other ideologies, in this case 1 Engineer and 1 Scientist. The extra strategic resources is increased to 50% to match the base scenario.
- Bionics:
	- Increased priority for AI factions that prefer Science Victory. Priority for AI factions that prefer Culture Victory reduced to 0.
	- Weather Engineering no longer doubles the Power output of Solar collectors and Wind farms.
	- Mutagens no longer adds Culture to Hospitals and Medical Labs, but it allows them to be constructed twice as fast.
	- Eugenics now only grants extra starting XP to Personnel units, but it grants them 25 XP. (When combined with Total War, this allows Personnel trained in the city that owns the Military Academy for every faction that isn't locked out of Supremacy, sans Enclavers, to start with a minimum of 4 promotions. It also lets Camelot's Excalibur Knights choose 4 promotions if the city with the Military Academy has a Riding Arena.) Additionally, the +2 Faith from having 2 active specialists is now +2 Happiness.
	- Transhumanism no longer reduces the cost of Faith purchases.
	- The bonus to Utopia Project construction speed has been moved to Naturalism's finisher. It now gives a bonus towards the Biosphere and Colony Ship projects.

**Promotion Adjustments**
- Forage has been nerfed again, this time to remove the unit healing on killing enemy units.
- The Reconnaissance promotion line is nerfed as follows:
	- Level 1 no longer awards bonus XP from combat.

	- Level 3 is now just +1 movement.
- Shock, Pursuit, and Loose Formation are no longer available for Scrapper units. Pursuit is now available for Armor units, but it is nerfed to remove the unit healing on killing units.
- Self-Repair now gives the March effect (unit heals every turn) to Purge Robots.
- Prospector slightly buffed to increase the possible Water yield from ending the unit's turn atop Rubble/Ruins and increase the Strength bonus from escorting Civilians to 15%.
- Sea Raider buffed to grant a combat bonus against wounded units and allow the ship to heal 25 HP for each kill.

**Resource Adjustments**
- Aluminum now spawns on Tundra tiles.
- Hexlock's Chemicals are now Strategic Resources as they should be according to Hexlock's UA instead of Luxury Resources. Hexlock now actually suffers from early-game Happiness issues as intended.
- Scriptures no longer have any stat yields on their own.

**Tile Improvement Adjustments**
- In general, most Great Improvements now benefit from improved stat scaling.
- Academies now gain +3 Science instead of +2 from the relevant techs. The first +3 now comes at Laboratory instead of Electronics.
- Artificial glaciers can now be built on Mountains.
- Artificial oases are now available earlier at Land Remediation and can be built on Desert Swamps (gaining an additional +1 Food/Water if built on those tiles). However, the Water they award enemy factions for pillaging is doubled.
- Crystal Refineries now start at +4 Science but their adjacency bonuses are nerfed; they now gain +2 Science, +1 Water with 3 or less adjacent Refineries, increasing to +4 Science, +2 Water with 4 or more. Their Production gains are also reduced, only gaining +2 from Coal or Oil tiles.
- Drydocks now start at +4 Production and gain a total of +6 Production/Science from tech progression.
- Endowment Houses are adjusted as follows: Start at +6 Faith, gain an additional +1 Water/Culture/Faith from tech progression, but only gain +1 Food from having adjacent food sources (instead of +1 Food for each adjacent food source).
- Food source improvements no longer add extra Food (or remove Water yields) when built on fresh water tiles. Artificial oases, which were buffed to add both Food and Water on those tiles, are exempt from this nerf.
	- Grasslands nerfed further to remove the adjacency bonuses from Tree plantations and Artificial oases entirely.
- Hexlock's standard Refineries have had their adjacency bonuses reduced by 1, but gain +1 to their respective yield at Laboratory and at Advanced Materials.
	- VX Refinery now adds Food instead of Faith.
- Manufactories now start at +4 Production and scale to +12 from tech progression, along with +2 Food/Science. However, the stat buff at Electronics has been pushed back to Advanced Materials.
- Narcotics farms now start at +2 Water, +4 Culture and gain an additional +2 Water with Hydroponics and +4 Culture with Social Engineering.
- Oracles now start at +6 Faith and gain +2 Culture with Chemistry, but no longer provide Happiness.
- Outposts are adjusted to gain their +4 Production bonus from researching Combined Arms instead of building atop Strategic Resources.
- Prison farms gain an additional +4 Production with Social Engineering.
- Seminaries now start at +4 Faith, increasing to +6 with Education, but no longer provide any Culture on their own.
- Settlements are now exclusively a Great Administrator improvement:
	- They no longer provide Science yields.
	- They no longer provide Water yields until researching Incentivization, at which point they add +2 of that stat.
	- Their Food adjacency bonuses are nerfed, restricted to a maximum of +2 with 3+ adjacent Food sources.
	- They start at +4 Culture and gain an additional +4 from tech scaling.
- Tree plantations now gain their last stat boost at Atmosphere Remediation instead of Geo Engineering.
- Water pumps buffed to +4 base Water, +2 gained at Decontamination. Until the gold-to-science slider is removed from the base mod, I don't dare buff this improvement any further.
- Wasteland Stations now start at +2 Food/Water instead of the original +1 Food/Water, +1 from Currency, given that the Harbingers start with that tech so that particular bit of stat scaling is pointless. They no longer gain Food from adjacent Food source tiles, but are buffed to receive an extra +1 Food/Production and +2 Gold from tech scaling.

#### May - September 2024

Several of the following adjustments are based on what is planned for the Rebirth Edition of base DeCiv should it ever be released. Several others are also being included in the "DeCiv 2" fork that is the effective continuation of pre-Rebirth DeCiv.

**Barbarian Adjustments**
- Barbarian Water units are no longer allowed to pillage tiles.

**Tech Adjustments**
- Advanced Materials now requires Lasers. This change is also present in the "DeCiv 2" fork.

**Faction Adjustments**
- All factions that started in the Rebuilding era lose the relevant starting techs.
- Blackwarden no longer loses its Strength bonus in foreign land while the faction is unhappy.
- Children of Rust is no longer locked into Collectivism at the start of a game.
- Crimson Line, The Harbingers, and Proklyatyye have been designated as "Russian Unifier" factions in their UAs for the purposes of component sharing.
- Hexlock now only creates one unique strategic resource with its improvements (previously five in the pre-Rebirth versions). The Compound Mix buildings instead require the city to work the Refinery whose stat corresponds to the GP it provides. Crystal Refineries provide a Refined version of the Experimental Chemicals, which regains its lost status as a Luxury Resource, but is consumed by the Meltdown building. Additionally, they now build National Wonders 15% faster.
- The Mariners' UA gifting Sea Raider to their infantry units after adopting Advanced Piracy now also applies to Low Tech units.
- New Star's UA no longer increases the rate of generating Great People. Instead, it now gives their Civilian and Support units the Thermoptic Camouflage promotion for free, and allows them to gain 15 Influence with City-States for gifting these units.
- The Patriots now receive +1 Production/Science to most defensive buildings (e.g. Walls and everything required by it).

- Spy names have been added for the base scenario's factions.
	- Atlas spy names are taken from characters in *Atlas Shrugged.*
	- Children of Rust spy names use a stereotypical Native American naming theme.
	- Hexlock spy names are taken from notable robots and AIs IRL.
	- Ignis spy names are taken from villainous characters in the *Mad Max* franchise.

	- Mariner spy names are taken from characters in *Waterworld.*
	- New Afrika spy names are taken from notable IRL Black Panther Party members.
	- New Star spy names, I decided to have a little fun here and take them from fictional characters whose last names are all Starling.

	- Proklyatyye spy names are taken from *Roadside Picnic* and two of the video game franchises it inspired, *S.T.A.L.K.E.R.* and *Metro 2033*.

**Building Adjustments**
- Condenser Cooler now removes itself from the cities it's built in when it goes obsolete at Atmosphere Remediation. However, this is hidden from the player in-game.
- Distillery (and Moonshinery) updated to account for new resources.
- Earthscraper nerfed to only give 1 free pop instead of 2 and only a 75% reduction to population loss and garrisoned unit damage from nukes instead of full protection. However, the population requirement for building is now more lenient, only needing 15 instead of the previous 20, and it no longer costs maintenance and is cheaper to purchase.
- Hydroponic Farming loses one Farmer slot, but now actually adds +2 Food to Lakes instead of +1 (this was supposed to have happened earlier).
- Listening Post (and replacements) no longer boost GP generation at all. It is now the Tier 1 anti-spy building (a change that was also implemented in the new "Deciv 2" fork).

- Prison Camp (and slaver faction replacements) also nerfed to inflict a -2 Happiness penalty on annexed cities.
- Public School now has a base yield of 2 Science, but the scaling Science yields from city population are now applied at Networking.

		- Bishop's Storehouse updated to account for a new resource.
	- The Harbingers:
		- Austere Processing Hub no longer requires Census Chambers in every city, due to the espionage updates.

		- Hexlock Chemical Company now grants Resupply to Personnel units just like the standard Food Processing Plant.

		- Rehabilitation Center is now the pseudo-Work Camp replacement instead of Triage and it will remain intact if the city is captured.
	- The Patriots:
		- Arsenal of Liberty's cost reduction reduced from 60% to 30%. It no longer requires surprlus Power for the Weapon copies or unit training speed bonus.

**Wonder Adjustments**
- Due to issues that have been caused by recent AI behavior changes reverting some of their previous behavior, the identity wonders for each faction are now automatically constructed once the capital is founded.
- Earthscraper Project is no longer exclusive to Collectivists or the capital city and now automatically builds an Earthscraper in the city that builds it. It has also been added to the "DeCiv 2" fork.
- Fusion Reactor harshly nerfed - instead of doubling the faction's Power supply, it adds a fixed 40 units of Power, and the Production bonuses are reduced by roughly 40% (now +5 and +15%).
- Microwave Power Satellite harshlly nerfed; the added Production to Solar collectors is reduced to +1 (was originally +4).
- National Reservoir System now increases the owning city's total Water yields by 10%.

**Unit Adjustments**
- Advanced Armor buffed to 100 Strength and loses the penalty to attacking cities.

- Mounted Ranged units (Skirmisher, Dragoon, Light Cavalry, Border Patrol, and replacements) are now their own unit type and mostly follow the same promotion tree as Siege and Helicopter units. They no longer use a fake Mounted unique.
	- Also, the two Civilian units (Mounted Worker and Great Caravan) that used Mounted as a fake unit no longer do so (but still require Stables).
- Multiple barbarian units have lost 2 or more of their free promotions (most of these nerfs are also applied to the DeCiv 2 fork):
	- Bikers and Insurgents lose Skirmish, Forage and March

	- Rebels lose Ambush, Forage and Urban Warfare I
	- Irregulars lose Skirmish and Urban Warfare I
	- Partisans lose Skirmish, Precision, Extended Range, and Urban Warfare I
- Purge Robots are now their own unit type. They must still be "given" promotions and cannot earn them.
- Seastead Vessel receives reduced tile improvement construction time.
- Stalkers now start with the Prospector promotion instead of Forage, and their Strength buff at Rifling is increased to 25%.
- Workers (but not Mounted/Mechanized Workers or CS Worker replacements) may now build water improvements (now that a resource that can spawn on Lakes has been introduced).
- Crimson Line UUs:
	- War Tram and Armored Train's base movement reduced from 4 to 2.
		- War Tram's bonus against infantry units increased to 50% to compensate. It now obsoletes at Railroads and upgrades to the Armored Train.

		- Crimson Sniper now replaces Black Ops and has had its stats adjusted accordingly. Also, it gets double strength when attacking other Personnel units.

- Medic I and II are no longer accessible to Shooter or Mounted Ranged units.

**Policy Adjustments**
- Expansionism:
	- Restorers' old effect moved to Reclaimers. It now adds a 5% Production bonus towards all buildings.
	- Citizen Militia's Production bonus to all cities moved to Restorers and no longer requires a garrison.
	- Reclaimers' old effect was thrown out entirely for giving way too many extra copies of strategic resources.
	- Courier Service now adds +15% Water to cities connected to the capital instead of slowing CS influence degradation.
- Theocracy:
	- Organized Religion now adds +1 Culture instead of +1 Happiness to Shrines, Monasteries and Megachurches.
	- Divine Mandate no longer adds stats to Monuments. Instead, it now adds +1 Happiness to Shrines, Monasteries and Megachurches.
	- Exodus of the Evangelists now requires the player to have enhanced their religion before it can be adopted. This is done to prevent players from taking two of the "Reformation" beliefs, and also to prevent the AI from screwing itself out of the bonus belief on higher difficulties.
- Monopoly:
	- Mass Consumption no longer adds yields to improvements. Instead it gains Reclaimers' lost effect of preserving Happiness from trading away the last copy of owned luxuries.
	- The finisher bonus now adds +1 Water/Production to Hexlock's Refineries along with the unique improvement of a new faction.
- Bionics:
	- Transhumanism now adds a flat +12 Global Happiness instead of 33% reduction to Unhappiness in the capital.

**Belief Adjustments**
- Art of War starts at a flat 200 Faith per unit purchase (Standard speed), and the cost actually increases with the era (300 in Rebuilding, 400 in Industrial, 600 in Postmodern, 800 in Information, 1000 in New Future and Singularity) like it would in official Civ 5 and standard Unciv rulesets (and does in Rekmod) but unlike any other Faith purchase in DeCiv. This is as it should be if the belief is to be allowed to exist at all.
- Blessed Green updated to account for Enclavers' Fortified Farm UI.
- Cathedrals no longer have an Administrator slot, but they now add +5 Culture.

- Harvest Festival updated to account for new resources.
- Spiritual Research now adds Science yields instead of Culture yields.

**Improvement Adjustments**

- Artificial glacier, for all that this improvement matters given how late in the game it comes, is buffed to add +2 Science.
- Borehole nerfed to +3 base Production.
- Crystal Refinery provides 3 copies of the consolidated Experimental Chemicals, and if built on Coal or Oil tiles it provides an additional copy of those resources.
- Drydock nerfed slightly to lose +1 of its scaling Production and Science yields. Also, until such time as water improvements are no longer destroyed outright by pillaging, it is now unpillagable.
- Fishing Boats and Modular Islands may now be built either slowly (allowing the Work Boat to keep building improvements afterward) or instantly.
- Manufactory nerfed to lose +2 of its scaling Production yields.
- Mine nerfed to lose the second +1 Production boost at Railroads. Also, it cannot be built on resources it doesn't improve.
- Pasture buffed to move its +1 Food gain to Ecology, but it now properly obsoletes at Genetics.
- Tree plantation no longer has a tech requirement for building on Badlands or Hills.

**Terrain Adjustments**
- A new unique, "Impeded Terrain", has been added and applied to terrains where cities are not supposed to be built.
- Mountains can now only have Artificial glaciers built on them, putting a stop to one particular Enclavers hijink. This will likely be changed later to allow a handful of other standard improvements to be built on those tiles.
- Springs can now only have Water pumps built on them, as another screw you to the AI and its primitive sanity checks. (*Stop* wasting your Great Improvements on those tiles, dammit!) This change is also present in the DeCiv 2 fork.

**Resource Adjustments**
- As in DeCiv 2, Power can no longer be traded. City-States are once again allowed to build the main Power Plant buildings.
- Aluminum may now spawn on Permafrost.
- Grain is now somewhat less common.
- Horses may now spawn on flat Wasteland, but are rarer on that terrain.
- Plankton is now a Bonus resource.

- Stim Trooper (Standalone UU for Hexlock, 250 production cost, 60 combat strength, 3 movement, heals 20 damage on kill, consumes both Weapons and Experimental Chemicals, upgrades to Exo-Trooper)

**New Resources**
(I expect some of these to also be added to the "Deciv 2" fork)
- Cactus (Luxury, spawns in flat Desert, improved by Farm but NOT Grassland, affected by Greenhouse)
- Deepwater Fish (Bonus, spawns in Ocean, improved by Fishing Boats and Bioculture)
- Maize (Bonus, spawns in flat Badlands/Desert, improved by Farm and Grassland, affected by Greenhouse)

- One entirely new technology, Astrogation, has been added alongside the DeCiv 2 techs.

- Future Tech now requires Astrogation and Stealth, but no longer requires Human Genome since the latter is required for Rewilding, which in turn is required for Geo Engineering.

	- Interpretative Center has been temporarily deleted. (I say "temporarily", but who knows how long it will be before Tourism mechanics are implemented)

- Industry buildings:
	- Oil Plant nerfed; the amount of Power it provides is cut in half (now +2 base Power, +1 if Oil supply doesn't go negative, +1 at Plastics).
	- The repurposed Recycling Plant is renamed to Materials Recovery Facility and nerfed due to concerns with providing too much Production now that it's available earlier. The percentage Production boost is reduced to 10% and now only applies towards building construction.

	- Water Plant and Rainwater Harvester buffed to +25% total Water.

- The Green Palace (Deciv 2 wonder) nerfed to reduce the added Food to Factory Farms to +2.

**Unit Adjustments**

- Military Engineers and Aurelian Group's Diggers can no longer consume themselves to instantly tunnel through Mountains; with Tunnels being a standard improvement in Deciv 2, the units must now slow build them. However, construction time is cut in half for Military Engineers once Replaceable Parts is researched. Mechanized Workers can still instant tunnel.
- Naval unit adjustments (mostly nerfs):
	- Raiding Craft + replacements moved from Sailing to Optics.

- Art of War cannot be adopted as the Reformation Belief if the player has adopted a Worship Belief. This will only be a temporary nerf as another, much harsher one is planned for a future update.
- Power of Light now gives Faith equal to 33% of a defeated unit's Strength after determining the old effect (25% of damage dealt to all units) was awarding a little too much Faith.

- Crimson Line has had the following adjustments:
	- It no longer gets an inherent reduction in policy cost increase from cities owned.
	- Its 10-turn Production bonus triggered upon the outbreak of war now requires the player controlling the faction to be the one declare war.
	- AI players controlling the faction should now be slightly less likely to declare war on you and somewhat more likely to fight alongside you in war.

- Navy Shipyard no longer generates Great Admiral points.
- Faction UBs:

	- Hexlock: Compound Mixes can no longer be purchased. They are also slightly more expensive to build (75 for standard, 150 for Meltdown).
	- New Star: Gideon Scanner and Rally Station no longer relocate to the new capital due to a game-breaking bug.

**Wonder Adjustments**
- Conscript Survivors' Production cost increased by 5, but it now provides 4 Slaves and 2 Warriors.
- Constitution Hall no longer adds Happiness to active Administrators; instead it adds a flat +1 Happiness to each city that has at least 2 active specialists. In retrospect, adding "Administrators provide Happiness" back in after removing it during the main rounds of Happiness nerfs was a big mistake and I should not have forgotten this.
- Eagle Rock Complex now gives a free Armory in the capital, restoring the Patriots' early access to higher tier units (but leaving them crippled if they lose their capital).
- Exotic Bazaar now adds +1 Water to each non-wonder building that provides Slaves instead of providing Water based on how many slaves the Caliphate has accumulated, due to an update that broke the functionality of the old unique.

- Faction UUs:
	- Central State (Forgotten Factions): Recovered Dongfei Missiles cannot be purchased. (Ensure you enable Forgotten Factions first, Outlaws last to make the nerf stick.)
	- Charybdis Division (Followers of the Green): Great Submarine Commander now replaces the Great Admiral instead of the Great General and gets the Admiral's healing bonuses but not the Drydock GI. It can still be expended to start Golden Ages. (Again, ensure Outlaws is enabled last to make the change stick.)
	- Crimson Line:
		- War Tram now gets +2 Movement in Road and Railroad tiles.
		- Volt Driver now upgrades to Machine Gun. Additionally, its defense and ranged strength values have been swapped.
	- Hexlock: Field Scientists can no longer be purchased, and their Production cost increases by 100% of the base amount every two eras starting at the Neofeudal era.
	- Nowa Polska: Kosynier nerfed; instead of doubling as a Worker, it now insta-builds Farms by consuming the unit.
	- The Oathsworn: Continental Generals now generate Golden Age points from combat.
	- The Patriots:
		- Privates now have 20 combat strength (up from 10) and cost 40 Production (up from 25).
		- Carryover from Deciv 2 branch: Marines and Spec Ops have their production cost reduced after Replaceable Parts is researched.
	- Proklyatyye: Mutants, Super Mutants, Desolators and Contaminators now have the "Cursed" fake unique for filtering purposes (currently used by one UB).
- City-State UUs:
	- Almaty: Instead of keeping the base State Guard's +25% Strength in friendly territory, the Alma State Guard now gets +30% Strength that decreases the further away it is from the capital.
	- Defiance: Ark Hunters now start with Hazard Pay instead of Prospector.

**Promotion Adjustments**
- Followers of the Green: Oceanic Mutation (unique promotion of Great Submarine Commander) is now a flat +1 Movement due to the unit becoming a Water unit.
- Skirmish's evade rate reduced from 75% to 50%.
- Terrascape now consumes all remaining movement points on the Mechanized Worker when a terraforming charge is used.

**Policy Adjustments**
- Sovereignty:
	- Unlocking the tree will no longer unlock notifications for new barbarian camp spawns - this has been moved to Global Uniques.
- Naturalism:
	- Ecodefense will no longer spawn free Eco-Terrorists if nukes are disabled.
- Legacy:
	- Hegemony buffed to +30 resting influence and -33% influence degradation.

**Belief Adjustments**
- Follower Beliefs that add Food yields of 2 or more per city are no longer mutually exclusive.
- Defender of the Faith and Just War nerfed from 20% combat bonus to 15%. Players also cannot pick both beliefs in the same religion (yes, this is another "screw the AI" adjustment because any AI controlled faction that has the ability to adopt them both *will* adopt them both before considering any other beliefs).
- Followers of Old World Crafts buffed to include three additional buildings (two of which were newly added and made specifically to buff this somewhat underpowered belief).
- God of Love's population requirement reduced from 4 to 3.
- God of Walls' combat bonus for cities when bombarding enemy units increased to 50%.
- Jesuit Education now allows purchasing Observatories with Faith.
- Primacy can once again be adopted. Its new effect grants players who select it as their Founder Belief all of the Faith and 10% of the Culture produced by allied City-States. (Yes, City-States do construct Faith buildings even though they can't use them.) It will be less likely to be picked by the AI if there are less than four City-States, and will not be picked at all by the AI if there are less than two.
- Religious Unity is less likely to be picked by the AI if there are less than four City-States, and will not be picked at all by the AI if there are less than two.

**Improvement Adjustments**

- Proxy Office (replaces Prison Camp for Atlas, no bonuses or penalties beyond the Courthouse effect)
- Shale Extractor (replaces Oil Refinery for Atlas, +1 additional Production on Oil tiles and +1 additional copy of Oil, also added to Deciv 2)
- Soaper (standalone, unlocks at Chemistry, requires a worked Cattle, Goats, Hogs, or Salt tile, adds +2 Local Happiness, maintenance cost 1, boosted by Followers of Old World Crafts)

**New Wonders**

- International Ordnance Museum (world wonder, unlocks at Hoplology, +3 Culture to all Weapons tiles owned by the faction, new land and water units trained in the city earn XP 50% faster)

- Longbowman (Crossbowman replacement for Camelot Foundation, +7 ranged strength, starts with Extended Range)

- Pirate Mothership (standalone Barbarian UU, 35 defense, 75 ranged strength, 5 movement, 3 range + intercept range, uncapturable, +30% more strength when attacking, can move after attacking, 2-in-3 chance to evade melee units, spawns a Savior of the Sea every other turn, standard barb promotions, only two can exist at a time)
- Trebuchet (Cannon replacement for Camelot Foundation, -50 Production cost but -3 defense strength and -2 ranged strength, Blast Furnace not needed, unlocks at Construction)

**New Promotions**
- Cut Away the Self (exclusive to Celestial Collective, three levels, allowing the unit to generate additional Culture/Faith and making it uncapturable at Level 3, but Level 2 prevents it from fortifying/sleeping and can only be taken while the unit is wounded)

#### October 2025

**Building Adjustments**
- Aerospace Facilities now allow a form of "airlifting" units. For balance reasons, this is currently limited to Civilian units (since Paradropping isn't a unit action and can't be modified to consume all movement points). They also increase the air unit capacity of cities to 10.
- Faction UBs:
	- The Harbingers: Investors' Chamber and Trustees' Committee renamed to Water Forum and Water Council.

**Wonder Adjustments**
- Due to a bug that has yet to be addressed, The Green Palace and Supercollider no longer construct Great Improvements; instead, they spawn the appropriate Great Person (Farmer for Green Palace, Scientist for Supercollider). This is expected to revert once those bugs are fixed.

**New Promotions**
- Airlift (lets a unit be "airlifted" to another city you control with an Aerospace Facility up to 30 tiles away)
