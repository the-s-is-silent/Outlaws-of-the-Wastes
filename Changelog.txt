Changes since the Harbinger update

1) August - October 2023

**Mod Options and Game Speed Adjustments**
- The survivor camp spawn rate has been drastically reduced (but is still significantly higher than base level) after determining that the previous rate was very much overpowered.
- Pantheons now cost 30 Faith to found on Standard speed and do not increase in cost as factions gain their Pantheons.
- Every player can now found a religion.
- Passive religious pressure reduced by 50%.

**Faction and City-State Adjustments**
- Almaty can no longer build Low Tech units. Their dialogue was also changed, to give them more personality.
- Atlas now has a Mountain start bias and can no longer build Enslaved units, Prison Camps or Work Camps.
- Bartertown now starts with Redomestication, Iron Working, and Chemistry. Their declaring war line was also changed.
- Crimson Legion now has Imperial Cult as their favored religion, and can no longer build Automated or Purge Robot units.
- Cult of Ignis and Deseret Nation both lose their Turn 1 prophet from their unique Wonder (they can still get a free one from the Theocracy tree).
- Cult of Ignis gains +1 Movement to Armor units, but loses the Culture boost to Coal Plants.
- Deseret Nation loses the Iron Working and Steel starting techs along with the temporary Science penalty, and gains their bonus Enhancer belief upon founding their religion.
- The Harbingers only get one-third as much Water and Influence from CS trade missions. However, the ban on building settlers has been rescinded.
- Hexlock gains double Encrypted Data in their UA, but loses the free Construction, Machinery and Engineering techs and gets Chemistry as a free tech instead.
- The Mariners now start with Rediscovery adopted, and after adopting Advanced Piracy their Ranged Water and Personnel units also gain the Sea Raider promotion.

**Specialist Adjustments**
- Administrators no longer give Happiness. They now provide +2 Culture while active.

**Promotion Adjustments**
- Forage awards 67% less Science per kill and no longer increases XP gain, but increases healing slightly in Rubble and Ruins tiles and is now available to Shooter units.
- Skirmish is no longer available to Shooter units unless they start with the promotion or upgrade from a unit that has the promotion. Not counting expansion mods, the only Shooter unit that starts with it is the Destroying Angel, and the only Shooter unit that can inherit Skirmish by upgrading from a Scout unit is the Border Patrol.
- Consequently, Precision and Suppression now list Forage instead of Skirmish as a prerequisite promotion.
- Suppression has been nerfed to a 25% combat bonus against Melee units.
- Hazard Pay no longer allows units to move immediately upon purchase.
- Bombardment separated into Water and Air versions, with three tiers for Bomber units, and it along with Siege are removed from Fighter units.
- Siege II and III, and Interception II and III, can no longer be awarded without first choosing the previous promotion tier.
- Targeting buffed to 33% Strength bonus vs Water units.
- Sentry removed from the promotion list for Shooter and Helicopter units, and the promotion requirements are adjusted to address an error in the promotion tree.
- Survivalism removed from the promotion list for Armor, Helicopter, and all Water and Air units.
- Evasive Maneuvers requires the second tier Fighter/Bomber promotions.
- Operational Range requires the third tier Fighter/Bomber promotions.
- Logistics no longer lists Evasive Maneuvers or Operational Range as requisite promotions, but lists Aerial Bombardment III as one.
- Air Repair can now only be accessed through Logistics.
- Chemical Weapons nerfed to lose almost half of its combat bonuses.

**Unit Adjustments**
- Nuclear weapons can no longer be purchased.
- Terraformer Part production cost is doubled.
- Ancient Armor is now a standalone unit and its strength has been reduced to 55. This gives players a chance to fight back in the early-game against enemy factions who are allied with Almaty or have the Army Depot in their possession.
- Ancient Armor also gains some buffs, however: base movement increased to 5 with another point added when starting its turn in friendly territory, and no combat penalty for attacking across rivers.
- Attack Boats (and the Mariners' replacement) no longer require Factories to build, so they're now properly available at Steam Power instead of being forced to wait until Manufacturing. They can now also spawn as Barbarian units.
- Border Patrol no longer starts with Skirmish.
- Expeditionary Force no longer obsoletes.
- Great Caravan's uniques were corrected so it's still properly considered a Great Merchant.
- Machine Guns are now Shooter/Personnel units.
- Neutron Bomb's production cost reduced to 1000.
- Purge Robot Proto's strength increased to 40 and the Low Tech modifier is removed. This gives Hexlock a fighting chance in the early-game.
- Scouts (and New Star's First Aid units) now upgrade to Forward Observers instead of Gunmen, putting an end to a commonly abused strategy.
    - Camelot's Wayfarers have to wait until Plastics to upgrade to Commandos instead.
- Seastead Vessels now require Oil to build.
- Speculatores regains the Forward Observer's Reconnaissance I starting promotion and also gains double combat strength when attacking cities.
- Wandering Doctors and Mobile Clinics, along with New Star's First Aid and Armed Ambulance units, are given a fake "Support" unique that I may do more with in the future.
- Wasteland Patrol is now locked behind Expansionism's national wonder and its production cost is increased to 60.
- Camelot UUs: Wayfarers, Knights and Brownsteel Knights have had their Production cost increased by 20 each, Excalibur Knights by 30.
- Deseret UUs: Battleaxe of the Lord no longer has a tech requirement and is available as a starting unit.
- Hexlock UUs: Field Scientist is now a standalone unit with 120 production cost and gets 2 instant build charges.

**Wonder Adjustments**
- Wincon wonders, International Trade Center, and Manhattan Project can no longer have their production hurried.
- Children of Rust's unique wonder, the Longhouse, has been replaced with First Kiva, which retains the Longhouse's effects but also buffs the wonder by adding 40 more city HP and a free Pantheon belief (awarded upon founding their religion).
- Salvage Tank Depot's Production penalty is replaced with a Production bonus.
- World Wonders tied to Ancient Wonders:
    - Salvage Army Depot replaced with Restore Army Depot, which costs 5x more Production and awards an Ancient Armor instead of a Tank, but adds +4 Production instead of +1 to the Army Depot tile and adds +25% Production towards Armor units in the owning city.
    - Nuclear Waste Museum is now a National Wonder, addressing an issue where it could still be purchased if Excavate Nuclear Waste was built first. It also adds 10% Science and Culture to its city, along with an additional +1 Culture/+3 Science to the ancient wonder tile, adding incentive to build it.
    - Excavate Nuclear Waste is adjusted to be far less punishing: the Food malus to the ancient wonder tile is removed and replaced with +3 Production, and the Food malus from the world wonder itself is cut in half.
    - Ally with Isolationists is now a National Wonder due to the same issue as Nuclear Waste Museum and its cost is now appropriate for an early-game wonder. Furthermore, it adds an extra point of Water/Science and two points of Culture to the Isolated Island, along with two points of Happiness to the city that owns it.
    - Annex Isolationists buffed to provide an extra copy of Weapons and Slaves and +1 population to the owning city. The -1 Culture penalty to the Isolated Island was moved to the world wonder itself and increased to -2.
    - Distribute Soft Drinks and Fist of God have been removed from the game.
    - Open the Vault loses the free Great Sage due to the wonder bug; however, it adds +2 Science and an extra +1 Culture/Faith to the Vault of Records. The free Sage will be restored once the bug is fixed.
    - Produce Soft Drinks buffed to add +2 extra Culture to the Soft Drinks Factory.
    - Salvage Graveyard buffed to +2 Production/Science to the Ship Graveyard tiles, 2 Oil and 2 free Patrol Boats.
    - The Last Paradise buffed to add +2 extra Culture and Happiness to the Oasis and +15% Water to the owning city, along with +1 each of Food, Water, Culture and Happiness to Artificial oases.
    - Turbine Hall buffed to add +2 Production/Water and +1 Science to the Hydroelectric Dam and +20% Production to the city that owns it.
    - Faust Project and Salvage Space Station no longer award free techs due to the bug involving World Wonders; they instead give +20% Science to the owning city and add extra yields to their respective Ancient Wonders (now +4 Science, +2 Production for both, with an additional +2 Culture for the latter) and an extra copy of Uranium for the former.
    - Pit of Sacrifice no longer awards a free Pantheon Belief because of that same bug; it instead kills 1 pop in the city and adds +25% Faith. This one will be reversed once the bug is fixed.
    - Mining Operation buffed to add an extra point of Production to the Mining Pit, along with +15% Production to the city owning the wonder.
- Public Broadcast's production cost increased to 500 (was previously a much, much too low 100) and it now requires every non-puppeted city you control to have a Broadcast Tower, not just the city it's built in.
- Broadcast Network's production cost adjusted to 500 base + 30 per owned city, and now requires every city to have a Television Studio, instead of only needing one in the city it's built in. It also only gives half as much Global Happiness.
- National College and Grand Monastery's base production cost reduced to 125 (were previously much, much too high, at 300/400 respectively).
- Medical Network now requires a Hospital in every city instead of a minimum of 4 cities and its base production cost is reduced to 125 (was previously 400, too high for its tech requirement) + scaling upward by 30 per owned city.
- Public Works Administration only awards one Golden Age now instead of a potential permanent Golden Age. (This was prior to a much more severe nerf in the base scenario replacing the Golden Ages with a pathetic +20 Culture per friendship declaration/defensive pact, which will NOT be incorporated.) It also loses its one measly Science point, but adds an extra Production point to all cities (that are connected to the capital). Its Production cost is reduced to 150 base + 30 per owned city.
- Heavy Equipment awards 2 free Workers and adds +3 Production to the owning city, and its Production cost is reduced to 150 base + 30 per owned city.
- Domestic Electrification's production cost reduced to 150 base + 30 per owned city (the original cost of 400 base + 50 per owned city was excessive to the point of obscenity).
- Media Center is now a normal building instead of a National Wonder and adds +2 Culture to Data tiles worked by the city.
- Fusion Reactor's cost has been reduced and its effects are drastically buffed: it now doubles the faction's Power supply and adds 25% Production to all cities.
- Homeland Defense Initiative now boosts production towards defensive buildings (Walls, etc.), reducing the time spent building them by 20%, and adds 15% more city strength from those buildings - gaining an effect that was removed from Castle Doctrine in the policy rebalance.
- Mobile Encampment adopts Rekmod Hungary's gimmick of being able to move the capital at will, once Munitions is researched.
- Naval War College now provides 4 Great Admiral points per turn.

**Building Adjustments**
- Congress variants providing a faction-wide Unhappiness reduction nerfed to 5%.
- All Council variants now cost a minimum of 100 Production.
- Defensive buildings are no longer all automatically unlocked by building Walls and must now be built in order: Hardened Defenses requires Defensive Emplacements, Battery and Bunker require Hardened Defenses, and Active Denial System requires Battery.
- Ranches now include Horses.
- Listening Post (and relevant replacements) nerfed to 25% GP generation with no extra bonus for Constitution factions.
- Monopoly building adjustments:
    - None of them penalize the city's Production any longer. However, they have a civ-wide limit of 2 and only one of the four can exist in a city.
    - Content Farms (and replacements) now unlock at Networking and require Data Centers instead of Broadcast Towers, and give +3 Science instead of +1 Culture.
        - Blackwarden's replacement gives +10% Water but no longer boosts city growth, and provides 3 Slaves instead of 1.

    - Machinery Production Lines boost the city's Production by 10%.
    - Publishing Houses give +2 Culture.
- Arcology Dome buffed to +250 City HP and +33% Water, but requires the city to be of size 20 or higher (or will once that base game bug is fixed).
- Carbon Capture no longer adds stats to Grassland tiles; it instead adds Food and Production to Tree plantations and consumes Power.
- Production building adjustments:
    - Stables (and replacements) nerfed to +1 Production per Horses tile, but the Food penalty is removed.
    - Blast Furnaces nerfed to +1 Production per Scrap/Metal tile, but the Food/Water penalties and Coal requirement are removed.
    - Aluminum Smelter no longer adds a Food/Water penalty to Aluminum tiles and restores the commented out +3 Production to the city, and also adds an Engineer slot.
    - Oil Refinery no longer adds a Food/Water penalty to Oil tiles and also adds an Engineer slot.
    - Oil Plant buffed to provide 2 Power (1 by default, 1 more if the faction hasn't run out of Oil) and remove the Food/Water penalty, and add an Engineer slot.
    - Plastics Factory buffed to add +1 Production to Plastics tiles and +2 Production to Oil tiles worked by the city.
- Culture building adjustments:
    - Broadcast Tower now gives 2 Culture, no Happiness, keeps its 25% boost to Culture, and costs 3 maintenance.
    - Television Studio now gives 2 Culture, 2 Happiness, and costs 2 maintenance.
    - Interpretative Center no longer gives Happiness and requires the city to own a National Wonder and be working a Settlement GI. However, it also adds 3 base Culture to compensate.
- Water building adjustments:
    - Market (and replacements) have a Merchant slot moved to Water Storage, but gain 1 Water in compensation (Gostiny Dvor gains 2 instead).
    - Water Plant gains a Merchant slot and +2 Water.
    - Greywater Treatment Plant loses the Production penalties, but also loses its single point of Food yield and one point of base Water yield.
    - Rainwater Purifier adds an additional +15% to the city's total Water yields, making it more useful than it originally was.
- Science building adjustments:
    - Libraries (and all base scenario replacements) no longer add Culture to Books tiles, but add +2 Science instead of +1 to those tiles. All faction replacements now keep this bonus instead of just the Ignis replacement.
    - Public Schools (and replacements) no longer add Culture, and count every 2 population for Science instead of every 3.
    - Data Center nerfed to +5 Science instead of +50% Science (Hexlock's Encoding Center gives +8 instead of +65%). It also loses the Culture bonus to Data/Encrypted Data tiles, but adds an extra point of Science to those tiles.
- Tidal Array adjusted to gate 2 units of power behind Geo Engineering, but add +1 Production to Artificial atolls and Floating Settlements worked by the city and +2 Production to oceanic Wind farms.
- Almaty CS UBs: Alma Air Base/Tank Depot now double production for their respective units.
- Defiance CS UBs:
    - Terra-Spire now awards a free Pale Veteran (their variant of the State Guard unit).
    - Lawkeeper Office now replaces the Town Hall and gives them +3 Happiness (+4 if they have Power), an extra Administrator slot, and more Production towards Personnel units, but it's no longer available at the start of the game.
- Camelot UBs:
    - Stone of Ages no longer awards a free Riding Arena and no longer generates Faith on its own. The player is now expected to search for tiles with the Horses resource to settle near.
    - Riding Arena adds +1 Culture to Horses.
    - The Round Table now boosts Production in all cities connected to the capital by 5% instead of adding 33% Production to the capital with Planned Economy and 5% Production towards all buildings in cities connected to the capital. Its bonuses to Water and Science require finishing the Monopoly/Rationalism trees, respectively.
- Deseret UBs:
    - Restored Temple of Zion buffed to +25% passive religious pressure; however it remains weaker than it was prior to the "nuclear option" update cutting religious pressure in half.
    - Bishop's Storehouse now adds +1 Food to Grain tiles on Desert.
    - Disciplinary Council adds +1 Faith/Happiness and +25% passive religious pressure to annexed cities, so there's now a reason to build it instead of the Listening Post in those cities.
    - Printing Press adds +2 Science.
    - General Conference counts Followers of the Majority Religion.
    - Quorum of the Twelve adds +2 Production to all Faith buildings instead of a percentage bonus towards building construction and adds 25% Faith to the capital, but has its production cost doubled.
    - Blue Castle Reactor's maintenance cost is reduced by 1.
- Harbinger UBs:
    - State Dacha also spawns a free Opolcheniye unit (newly added Militia replacement).
    - Census Chamber now adds an Administrator slot.
- Hexlock UBs:
    - Experiment on Survivors nerfed to lose the free Great Scientist (it now gives a Field Scientist instead). It also adds +2 pop to the capital instead of +1 to all cities. Also, it's only available in the capital, but this is mostly inconsequential.
    - Record Grid buffed by giving +1 Local Happiness while the faction has Power to offset their UA's malus and reducing its production cost to match that of the Library it replaces.
    - Stormfront Center and Overcouncil nerfed by increasing their production cost to 150 each.
- Ignis UBs:
    - Fuel Depot loses the Food/Water penalties and adds +2 Production to Oil tiles, but only adds +1 Production to the city itself while the faction has Power and loses half its Culture output. Like the Oil Refinery it replaces, it gains an Engineer slot.
    - Arena now adds an Administrator slot instead of +1 Happiness.
- Legion UBs: Colosseum buffed to +2 Happiness.
- New Star UBs: In accordance with the Mobile Encampment adjustment, Gideon Scanner and Rally Station are adjusted to be limited to 1, unbuildable if their opposite building is constructed, and unable to be purchased. Their production cost has also been increased to 150 each.
- Proklyatyye UBs: State Assembly and Politburo's production cost increased by 50 each.

**Belief Adjustments**
- The three pantheons that added Happiness to specific Natural tiles no longer do so.
- Follower beliefs that add +2 or higher Food yields are now exclusive from each other, as are Enhancer beliefs that add passive religious pressure.
- Annihilationism, Art of War, Atomic Judgment, Blessing of Peace, and New Zion are now locked behind Theocracy Complete.
- Atomic Judgment now only gives the Strength bonus to Nuclear Weapons.
- Atomic Children's Faith yields on Fallout/Toxic Waste reduced from 3 to 2.
- Blessing of Peace adjusted to +20% growth while at peace, +2 Food to Barracks.
- Faith Healers nerfed; healing for units adjacent to cities reduced to +10 HP and it's restricted to Personnel units for its unique promotion.
- God of Commerce adds +2 Water instead of +2 Science.
- Happiness in Faith altered to add +2 Production and +1 Culture/Happiness to Monasteries.
- Hymns of Praise moved to Pantheon and buffed to add +1 Water.
- Illuminated Order moved to Founder and its Faith discount on religious units moved to Missionary Zeal/Thought Control in a reduced amount (25% to each). Its new effect awards 50 Culture (modified by game speed) the first time each city converts to that religion.
- Itinerant Preachers, Primacy, and Religious Texts have been made inaccessible.
- New Zion buffed to award the player with a free Great Sage upon adopting the belief.
- Obey the Elders also adds +2 Food to cities with an active specialist.

- Works of Genius' Faith yields to Great Improvements cut in half and it now adds +1 Science/Faith to cities with an active Specialist.

**Policy Adjustments**
- The entire policy tree has been redone, borrowing mostly from Rekmod but making some deviations for the sake of lore + to keep it a bit more in line with a BNW-style expansion mod.

**Tile Improvement Adjustments**
- Artificial atolls no longer yield Happiness.
- Boroughs now provide +1 Science on Data/Electronics tiles and +1 Culture on Artifacts/Weapons tiles.
- Floating Settlements now yield Culture instead of Happiness for each adjacent Artificial atoll.
- Grasslands severely nerfed; they no longer yield Happiness and their adjacency bonuses from other natural tiles have been heavily curtailed.
- Outposts and Prison farms receive extra yields (+4 Production for the former atop strategic resources, +1 Production per adjacent Farm and +1 extra Food at Land Remediation for the latter) and provide 1 extra slave each.
- Refineries have their base yields increased by 1 and gain adjacency bonuses so they're not as utterly useless as they currently are in the base scenario. This is a temporary measure until the entire gimmick for Hexlock is redesigned.
- Research sites receive an extra +1 Science at Laboratory.
- Solar collectors and Wind farms provide 1 extra unit of Power if the player chooses Bionics as their ideology and adopts Weather Engineering, and gain +1 Production at Plastics and another +1 at Atmosphere Remediation (Wind farms on Ocean tiles gaining another +1 at Ocean Remediation).
- Solar collectors also have their construction time reduced to 10 turns (on Standard speed).
- Terrace farms receive extra food scaling (they now start at 2 base and add 1 with adjacent Farm or Grassland tiles) so they aren't obsoleted by Tree plantations being buildable on Hills.

**New Victory Conditions**
- Colonization Victory has been added, inspired somewhat by the "DeCiv in Alpha Frontier" fanfic-tier expansion mod for Alpha Frontier.
- The "proper" Domination Victory condition of only needing to capture all enemy capitals is also enabled.

**New City-States**
- The Pax, Research type, inspired by the Gene Roddenberry film *Genesis II*. If they spawn in the game, kiss the Cryo Sanctum wonder goodbye since it's awarded to them for free at the start.
- Hockeytown, Culture type.

**New Buildings and Wonders**
- Standalone:
    - Alternet Cafe, a Culture boosting building that consumes Power and grows stronger in larger cities (but not as strong as pre-nerf Public Schools)
    - Composite Materials Plant, which consumes Coal and Power to give a 10% boost to building construction in the owning city and add +1 Production to strategic resources, +2 Production to Manufactories (Note: this building has since been deleted)
    - Condenser Cooler, which consumes Coal to provide the owning city with more Water (10% total and +1 to worked Moisture traps), but obsoletes in the late-game
    - Sanctuary, a Happiness boosting building meant to encourage building Nature preserve improvements since it adds yields to those improvements (+1 Food/Water/Culture) but requires the city to be working at least 1
    - Sociopolitical Institute, a Culture boosting building that grows stronger with each social policy completed (starts at +2 Culture and +1 Administrator slot, gains +1 Culture per completed policy)
- Policy Specific:
    - Earth Clinic, locked behind Naturalism, boosting the city's Food/Culture yields and giving it access to part of the Faith Healers belief
    - Earthscraper Project, locked behind Collectivism, enabling construction of Earthscraper buildings which add 1 of every Specialist, +2 pop, a *lot* of city HP and make the city almost completely immune to pop loss from nukes.
    - Navy Shipyard, locked behind Rediscovery and requiring the player to finish the tree, boosting starting XP of naval units, giving those units a unique promotion, and adding +2 Production to Drydocks worked by the city along with +2 Great Admiral points per turn
    - Oceanological Center, locked behind Rediscovery, consuming Power and boosting Science/Happiness for coastal cities
    - Resettlement Bureau, locked behind Collectivism, converting 1 pop in the capital to a Civilian Convoy and adding a production boost to Civilian Convoys along with Food yields to Settlements (Note: this building has since been deleted)
    - Workers' Facility, locked behind Collectivism, provides a free Factory, boosts training speed of Civilian units by 25% and boosts the city's Science output by 10% but consumes Power, has high maintenance, and cannot be sold
- Faction/City-State Specific:
    - All City-States:
        - Defense Directorate, a defensive building to aid them against aggressive AI factions in the early-game, made in response to the latest update to DeCiv Redux enabling capital razing (Almaty, Hockeytown and Tellus get unique versions right away, other variants are planned later)

        - Central Press Service, a standalone UB giving them a unique luxury

        - Both the Thunderdome and Underworld will remain intact if Bartertown is captured
    - Calico CS:
        - Nanomaterial Factory, granting a new unique luxury and granting their units a unique promotion
    - Camelot Foundation:
        - Abbey, replacing the Monastery, adding +2 Water instead of costing maintenance

    - The Harbingers:
        - Pogost, replacing the Town Hall, boosting the city's Water yields (+2 base increasing to +3 and +1 Faith/Culture/Happiness with sufficient Power, along with +1 Water per trade route, +2 Water to Wasteland Stations worked by the city, and a Merchant slot instead of an Administrator slot)
    - Hexlock:
        - Advanced Chemical Refinery, a standalone UB for Hexlock locked behind Supremacy that boosts Refinery yields by 50% and grants Chemical Weapons to Purge Robots trained in the city, but consumes both Coal and Power
    - Proklyatyye:
        - Kolkhoz, replacing the Greenhouse, adds +2 Production, 2 Farmer slots instead of 1, and +1 Production to active Farmers in the city, but has higher maintenance (2 vs. 1)

**New Units**
- Great Admirals are added in the form of their present Rekmod implementation. They use the "Is part of Great Person group" unique and do not increase the GPP cost of other Great People.
- State Guard, a unit exclusive to City-States made in response to a hated update to DeCiv Redux that temporarily allowed capital razing.
    - Unique versions (so far):
        - Almaty: Alma State Guard, with the same combat strength/promotions as NBC Infantry and a combat bonus in friendly territory

- Newspaper, (currently) exclusive to the Almaty CS

**New Tile Improvements**
- Preservator, borrowed from Bamboolord's expansion mod with his permission, adjusted, and granted to The Pax CS. This GI gains yields from the finisher bonuses of Rationalism and Constitution (+4 Culture/Science during Golden Ages from the former, +2 Culture/Science from the latter)

	- The healing bonus has been removed partly for being relatively lackluster compared to other bonuses, partly because it doesn't seem to function at all.

**Quest Adjustments**
- Clear Barbarian Camp has been made unavailable by increasing the minimum civ number past what is possible, addressing a known issue also present in "The Barbarians" mod where allowing barb camps to award ruins bonuses prevents completion of the quest. (Part of this is also due to the City-States themselves being fully capable of clearing the quest before you can even if it wasn't bugged.)
- Contest Culture, Faith, and Technologies' duration reduced by 20%, now lasting 24 turns on Standard speed.
- All available quests are now weighted.

**Specialist Adjustments**
- Administrators adjusted to +3 Culture (which is where they should be).

**Tech Adjustments**
- Radar now has Electronics as an additional prerequisite tech, preventing players from skipping an entire technological era.
- Computers now has Electronics as an additional prerequisite tech and no longer increases Production or Science.
- Biology no longer increases city growth.
- Nuclear Fission renamed to Nuclear Power.

**Faction Adjustments**
- Atlas heavily nerfed:
	- They now have to wait until Education to get their free Great Scientist.
	- They no longer receive a bonus towards generating GP types other than Scientists.
	- They no longer start with any free techs aside from Electronics.
	- They no longer have a nonsensical (and frankly unnecessary) double Production speed bonus towards their unique Electrostatic Generators.
	- However, the early-game Science penalty has also been removed.
- Children of Rust nerfed; the Faith bonus only applies as long as the Ruins tiles are unimproved, and they no longer start with Redomestication.
- Crimson Legion now starts with Iron Working instead of Redomestication.
- Cult of Ignis nerfed again; they no longer get extra Faith from strategic resource tiles.
- New Afrika nerfed; the Great Wall effect in their UA now has an expiration date, and they no longer start with Redomestication. However, their combat bonus against larger civs no longer has a policy requirement.
- The Patriots now start with only one free tech - Munitions, instead of any of their original four - and no longer have an early-game Science penalty. Additionally, Citadels gain +2 Production/Science, increasing to +4 (along with an extra +2 Water) after entering the Industrial era.

**City-State Adjustments**
- Venice Beach's attacked/defeated dialogue was altered so it's no longer copied verbatim from Civ 5 Venice.

**Building Adjustments**
- Government:
	- Congress variants:
		- Camelot Foundation's Round Table is adjusted as follows:
			- Gaining the standard Council +10% growth bonus.
			- Removing the policy requirement on the Production bonus.
			- Removing the percentage Science yield in the capital after completing Rationalism.

		- Deadrock Clan's Smugglers' Guild now adds +3 Water/Culture to worked Narcotics farms and +2 Water/Culture to Casinos.
		- The Mariners' Trader's Congress no longer increases Influence gain from Water gifts to City-States; instead it adds scaling Water yields (+1 per 4 population) to all cities, +1 Water to city connections, and grants Culture equal to 10% of the total Culture output of allied City-States.
		- New Afrika's Survival Program now adds scaling Culture yields (+1 per 4 population) instead of a flat +2 Culture to all cities.
		- Politburo's State Assembly also adds scaling Production yields and now counts every 4 population instead of every 5.
	- Council variants:
		- Atlas's Think Tank buffed to give a +25% Production boost towards Science buildings and a +15% Production boost to cities other than the capital when they construct buildings owned by the capital.
		- Blackwarden's Board of Directors now adds +2 Water/Science to Personnel Offices and allows Military units to farm Water in combat equal to 10% of the damage they deal to enemy Military units.
		- Children of Rust's Defense Committee nerfed to reduce the Production bonus towards Military units to 10% and restrict it to Land units. However, it does gain the standard 10% Council growth boost.
		- Commonwealth's Embassy no longer boosts GP generation, but instead makes Water gifts to City-States yield 25% more influence, and it gains the standard Council bonuses.
		- Crimson Legion's Consulate now doubles the recovery rate of lost CS influence. This is a placeholder buff until Gunboat Diplomacy is added to Unciv.
		- Cult of Ignis's Seer Council's old effects have been thrown out; it now adds +2 Culture to every Fuel Depot and College of Mystics along with a +25% Production bonus towards Faith buildings and the standard 10% city growth boost.
		- Deadrock Clan's Grand Clan Manor now costs 100 Production (down from 200) but only gives 15 XP to newly trained units. However, it grants a +10% Production boost towards Personnel units and boosts city growth by 10% like most Council variants.
		- Deseret Nation's Quorum of the Twelve now adds +2 Science/Culture to all worked Great Improvements and excludes itself from its Production bonus (it's now applied to the three regular Faith buildings + Worship Belief buildings). It no longer allows Production to Faith conversion, and receives the standard 10% city growth boost.
		- The Mariners' Raider's Council now gives a +20% Production boost towards naval units and the standard Council +10% growth boost, but only to coastal cities.
		- New Afrika's Revolutionary Council now gives a +15% Production boost towards Personnel units.
		- Proklyatyye's Politburo no longer adds Culture/Happiness to Gulags; it instead adds +3 Production to them, and the Production bonus to Corrective Colonies and Listening Posts is increased to +3.
- Food/Growth:
	- Hospitals (and replacements) no longer gain +1 Food from having Harvested Organs.
		- The remaining "evil" faction replacements no longer have reduced food preservation compared to the standard Hospital.
- Industry:
	- Buildings that require specific non-Power resources (aside from the Work Camp) no longer add Engineer slots.
	- Bio Synthesizer has been moved to Plastics Recycling and now provides 2 copies of Oil, but no Aluminum or Uranium. You can now have up to 5 instead of 3.
	- Carbon Capture nerfed; it no longer provides Food at all (I thought I'd made this change earlier, but apparently not) and costs 3 maintenance instead of 2.
	- Composite Materials Plant has been deleted on account of it becoming redundant after reworks to other buildings.
	- Forge (and its replacements) no longer has a resource requirement and gains an Engineer slot, but no longer gains benefits from having Machine Parts.
		- Children of Rust's version also no longer adds Production to Scrap resources, though it regains the normal Forge's bonus to Land unit production.
		- Deadrock Clan's version has been removed from the game.
		- Proklyatyye's version no longer makes worked Uranium tiles have negative Water yields.
	- Heat Plant moved to Synthetic Materials and now provides 4 units of Power.
	- Metal Reprocessor's Production cost increased to 1000, but it now provides 2 copies of Aluminum.
	- Nuclear Plant now provides 16 units of Power but cannot be built if the city owns an Oil Plant. Deseret and Proklyatyye's versions have been adjusted accordingly.
		- Proklyatyye's Atomic Pile starts at 8 units of Power and scales to 16 with techs.
	- Oil Plant now provides up to 8 units of Power, scaling with techs + resource availability. However, it no longer increases Production.
	- Oil Refinery now provides a second copy of Oil after researching Advanced Materials.
	- Plastics Factory now adds +5% to the city's total Production.
	- Plastics Reprocessor has been removed from the game.
	- Prison Camps and their replacements are now 3x more expensive to build. The cost of purchase is increased further (except for factions that outlaw slavery).
		- The standard camps and Commonwealth's Black Site no longer penalize the annexed city's Food supply.
		- Legion Camps and Processing Centers have their Food penalty reduced from 25% to 10%. However, the former only adds +5 City Strength.
		- Corrective Colonies lose the flat -2 Food penalty (but keep the percentage Food penalty).
	- Recycling Plant is now a Production building instead of a Power building, adding +1 Production to Scrap/Metal/Plastic and Strategic resource tiles, +15% to the city's total Production output, and 1 Engineer slot, but does not provide resources and consumes Power to build.
	- Transport Network *severely* nerfed; it now only adds +1 Production to Boroughs and no other stats.
		- Childen of Rust's Bike Path is now a standalone Culture building instead of a Production building and is available at Railroads; it adds +1 Culture to Rubble/Ruins tiles that are up to 2 tiles away from the city center.
	- Uranium Centrifuge's Production cost increased to 1000 and its restrictions are tightened; you can now only have 3 and they must be in cities with a Nuclear Plant.
- Military:
	- Armament/Armor Production Lines and Aerospace Facilities no longer have negative modifiers to the owning city's Production. However, they now have a maintenance cost of 3 Water.
	- Armor Production Line is overall nerfed; its Production bonus towards Armor units is reduced to 33% (and turns off when Power is lost) and it no longer awards a free Tank. To compensate, building it unlocks access to a new promotion for Armor units, which is given for free to newly-trained Armor units in that city.
	- Defense Directorate and its variants have been adjusted quite a bit:
		- They are now exclusive to the city-states' original city, just in case issues crop up in the (not as rare as it should be) case where a city-state captures another city-state or a faction's capital or holy city.
		- They no longer increase the City-State's unit supply.
		- They only allow 3 units to be maintenance free (down from 5; Almaty and Tellus retain the original amount).
		- They no longer increase the City-State's city strength (except for Almaty).
		- They no longer provide free units each time the City-State goes to war.
		- They only provide one free State Guard, along with two free copies of a new and purely defensive unit (except for Issaquah which keeps the Hawkman Braves).
- Science and Culture:
	- Jeweler no longer adds a Merchant slot (it adds +2 Water/Culture instead).
	- University slightly buffed; it now adds an extra +2 Science instead of +1 when the owner has access to Power.
	- The three base game faction variants no longer senselessly have reduced Science compared to the standard University, but also no longer give Great Person Points. They are further adjusted as follows:
		- Crimson Legion: College of Rhetoric now adds +2 Happiness and gives a Scientist slot instead of an Administrator slot, but does not add Culture.
		- Cult of Ignis: College of Mystics now adds an unconditional +2 Culture, along with +1 Faith when they have access to Power.
		- Deadrock Clan: Trade College now adds +2 Water and no longer has a maintenance cost, but does not add Culture or a Merchant slot.

	- Media Center can now be built with worked Books tiles and adds +2 Culture to those tiles, but no longer adds Great Administrator points.
- Other faction/CS-specific buildings:
	- Almaty:
		- Alma Air Base only gives one free Salvaged Helicopter again and no longer increases city HP.
		- Alma Tank Depot no longer increases city strength.
		- Neither of the above buildings provide any resources anymore. Also, the production bonus to their respective units is reduced to 50%.
    - Atlas:
        - Kruger Line now adds +3 Culture to the capital, but only adds +1 Production to Railroads and +1 Water per Trade Route. Its cost is greatly reduced, to 150 + 30 per owned city (was originally 625).
	- Blackwarden:
		- Personnel Office regains its commented out Merchant slot, gains an Administrator slot, and adds a +10% Production bonus towards Personnel units along with a 25% cost reduction in tile purchases. However, its Production cost is increased to 160 and it no longer gains bonuses from having Slaves.
		- Resource Management Server no longer provides Slaves.
		- These two changes mean that Blackwarden is no longer a Slaver faction.
	- Camelot Foundation:
		- Sangreal Vault is now an unconditional +2 Science and adds +1 Culture/Faith with access to Artifacts.
		- Riding Arena adjusted to +2 Culture/Happiness.
		- Constabulary's maintenance cost reduced to 1.
		- Parish School now adds +2 Science/Faith.
	- Children of Rust:
		- Commune now adds +2 Food with access to Power and regains the standard Town Hall's Administrator slot, but no longer has any base yields and no longer reduces tile purchase costs. It now unlocks at Civil Service and costs 120 Production.
	- Crimson Legion:
		- Crucifixion Fields no longer reduce Food (I thought I'd made this adjustment earlier, but apparently not). They will be destroyed if another faction takes the city.
		- Caesareum buffed to +2 Production.
	- Cult of Ignis:
		- Plantation now belongs to Deadrock Clan as a Greenhouse replacement.
		- Arena no longer adds an Administrator slot; instead it adds +1 Happiness while at war.
	- Deadrock Clan:
		- Plantation now unlocks at Botany like standard Greenhouses, costs 70 Production, and no longer adds a percentage boost to total Food yields. Instead, it adds +1 Food to active Farmers in the city and +1 Culture to Narcotics farms (along with the standard Greenhouse effect).
		- Clubhouse now generates 2 Water per turn and no longer costs maintenance.
		- Organ Farm now consumes Power in addition to consuming Slaves.
	- Deseret Nation:
		- Bishop's Storehouse no longer adds extra Culture/Faith from having access to Books.
		- Disciplinary Council's maintenance cost reduced to 1.

		- Pogost swaps its Merchant slot for an Administrator slot.
		- Census Chamber loses its Administrator slot and regains the normal Listening Post's +1 Happiness.

		- Compound Mixers now replace Distilleries, while Chemical Extractors are standalone buildings. The latter receives the Engineer slot that was on the former, loses the Culture penalty, and gains +2 Production.
		- Record Grids are now unsellable and add +1 Science to worked Refineries.
		- Private Labels no longer add Science to worked Refineries (that yield was moved to Record Grid). However, the base Water yield on the building itself is increased to +2.
		- Pre-Med Labs now add +1 Food to worked VX Refineries, increasing to +2 at Pharmaceuticals.
		- Gas Field's stats adjusted to +2 Science, +1 Production, -1 Food for Tree plantations (was +4 Science, -1 Food/Water) and +2 Science, +1 Production in the city with access to Exotic Seeds (was +1 Science/Production).
		- Advanced Chemical Refinery is much harder to unlock: you have to build the Chemical Weapons Laboratory first.
	- Hockeytown:
		- Ice Hockey Rink no longer provides the Alcohol luxury.
	- New Afrika:
		- Mosque has been temporarily removed from the game on account of it being inaccurate to their religion. When the building is reintroduced, it will be given to a new faction.
	- New Star:
		- Triage now costs 40 Production.
		- Emergency Response Network no longer adds an Administrator slot.
	- Proklyatyye:
		- Zemlyanka is now a City Defense building and it adds +1 Food to Tundra Camps and Tundra Tubers to help offset the double whammy of their growth penalties and Tundra start bias.

**Wonder Adjustments**
- All of the base scenario factions' starting wonders now have a base production cost of 0. The majority have also received further adjustments as detailed below:
	- Atlas Refuge nerfed to remove the Scientist slot; it receives +1 base Science and an extra +40 City HP in compensation.
	- Clan Hideout now gives Deadrock Clan's capital +2 Water and +100 HP.
	- Eagle Rock Complex loses its Engineer slot, but receives +1 base Production to compensate.
	- First Kiva no longer gives Faith until a Pantheon has been founded, and gives a Food Store instead of a Salvage Yard since they were gaining too much early Production.
	- Forum corrected to a 5% Unhappiness reduction (was still 10%) and no longer increases City HP, but it now adds +1 Water and awards 2 free Swordsmen instead of 1.
	- The Great Lighthouse now gives The Mariners's capital +2 Food if it's founded on a coastline, but no longer gives Faith.
	- Great Mosque has been temporarily removed from the game for the same reason as the normal Mosque.
	- Hex Corporation only spawns 1 free Purge Robot Proto instead of 2. To compensate, it also gives a 10% Production bonus towards all Promotion Nullifier units after researching Replaceable Parts. Additionally, its boost to City HP is removed it no longer gives a free Compound Mixer (it now gives a free Food Store, which is a huge nerf in more ways than one).
	- On the run now spawns 2 Wandering Doctor replacements instead of a Militia.
	- Peace Memorial no longer gives Faith. Instead, the +1 Local Happiness is given to all cities during peacetime.
	- Restored Temple of Zion now spawns the 2 free Battleaxe of the Lord units, at the cost of losing the late-game Culture boost. This was because the previous setup put Deseret at a significant early-game disadvantage and made them the undisputed worst faction on Marathon speed. Also, the amount of Faith generated by the wonder per turn is reduced to 1.
	- Sarcophagus buffed to +2 Production.
	- State Dacha no longer gives a free Food Store.
	- Stockpile slightly buffed, adding +2 Food instead of +1.
	- Stone of Ages now has its quote.
	- Temple nerfed further to remove its base Faith yields and Administrator slot. To compensate, it adds +1 Culture/Faith to all active Administrators, but requires Engineering to unlock this boost.
- Annex Isolationists now adds +5 Production instead of +5 Water to the Isolated Island.
- Convert Survivors and Resettlement Bureau have been deleted.
- Domestic Electrification now adds +1 Culture/Happiness to all cities connected to the capital instead of a potential +8 Happiness in the capital. However, its Production cost no longer scales according to how many cities the faction owns.
- Fusion Reactor now requires the capital to own a Nuclear Plant, but is buffed to add an additional +8 Production to the capital and all cities connected to it.
- Ground Control Center's Production cost reduced to 300 and it gives +3 Culture instead of Happiness. Adjustments to faction-specific replacements:
	- Atlas (Survey Center): Starts at +3 Science/+1 Culture, gains +5 Science/+2 Culture at Flight
	- Blackwarden (Operations Center): 150 base Production
	- Deseret (Deseret Data Center): 250 base Production, gains bonus for Automated units
	- The Patriots (Tactics Center): 100 base Production, moved to Munitions
- International Trade Center buffed to +5 base Water, +50% total Water yields for the owning city, and +3 Water from Trade Routes, adding more incentive to build it in the endgame. It also triggers an additional alert upon completion.
- Organ Lab no longer provides Harvested Organs, and instead adds +2 Food, +1 Happiness to every Hospital. This effectively means Harvested Organs become exclusive to Deadrock Clan, at least for the time being.
- Shake Down Survivors now costs 30 Production, but awards 4 Slaves and a Gangboss.
- Statue of Remembrance now has its flavor text/quote.

**Unit Adjustments**
- All three non-drone Bomber units have had their ranged strength reduced by 5 (and in the case of Stealth Bombers, their strength reduced by 15).
- Ancient Armor's strength further reduced to 50 and its Production cost increased to 150.
- Bartertown Security Force renamed (or rather, had its name corrected) to Bartertown Imperial Guard.
- Battleaxe of the Lord now has 28 strength (was previously 27).
- Brownsteel Knight's Production cost reduced by 10; the initial cost increase of 20 from standard Hussars was too high considering the difference in strength between the two isn't that great.
- Clansmen no longer require Clubhouses to be built, due to the building being available two tech eras later.
- Commandos now obsolete at Energy Weapons (since unlike normal Black Ops who consume 2 Weapons, Camelot SAS only consumes 1 so there's no point in letting Commandos remain trainable in the endgame).
- Destroying Angel no longer obsoletes.
- Field Scientists reverted to 70 production cost, 1 charge, but remain standalone units.
- Forward Observers and their replacements (with the exception of the Legion's Speculatores) can no longer capture cities. They now play the "shot" attack sound in combat.
- Great Farmers now add +2 population to a random city instead of +1 to all cities with their secondary ability.
- Great Merchants no longer create Settlements, but an entirely new Great Improvement.
- Hexlock's Purge Robots are now standalone units.
	- Proto and MKI are now Armor units. The former's Production cost is increased to 75.
	- MKI and MKII require Aluminum instead of their previous secondary strategic resource (Weapons for MKI, Oil for MKII).
- Machine Guns now start with Logistics and gain a bonus when attacking Scrapper and Shooter units.
- Mormon Battalions now cost 230 Production, matching the cost of the NBC Infantry unit which they are superior to despite replacing normal Infantry and unlocking earlier.
- Persevering Pax Researchers are no longer Great People. No more will City-State quests ask you to somehow acquire them.
- Rubble Gunmen now replace Crossbowmen, correcting the major error in the base game where Deadrock Clan had two unique units replacing Archers.
- Salvaged Helicopter's movement points reduced by 1 and ranged strength reduced by 10. However, its Production cost is reduced by 50.
- Seastead Vessel now uses a single unique for all Water improvements that are not specifically for improving Water resources, in the event that more such improvements are added in the future. Also, it can now enter and remove ice tiles.
- State Guards are now limited to 3 per City-State.
	- Alma State Guard's strength reduced to 40 and it now upgrades to Infantry instead of Exo-Troopers.
	- Pale Veteran's strength reduced to 38.
- Technopaths now actually get their intended endgame buff of a 30% Strength bonus at Artificial Intelligence. However, they now also consume Weapons and unlock later at Networking.
- Tree Lovers now cost 50 Production instead of 70, but only Tree plantations benefit from reduced construction time.
- Wandering Doctors buffed to 24 combat strength.

**Belief Adjustments**
- Acolytes of a New God now awards +100 Faith (modified by game speed) for each city conquered.
- Church Property buffed to +3 Water for each city following the religion.
- Feast of Flesh now adds +2 Food, +1 Happiness to Ranches, and cannot be taken alongside the other Follower Beliefs that add Food yields of +2 or higher (not counting Gardens).
- God of Beasts is now limited to the actual beast resources (Horses, Cattle, Goats, Deer). No more late-game Culture boosts from bug or water tiles.
- Isolationism and Worship Music have been deleted.
- Jesuit Education now allows purchasing Libraries.
- New Zion nerfed to restrict its stat yields to Seminaries + replacements and no longer spawn a free Great Sage for the first adopter.
- Religious Troubadours nerfed to reduce the Faith yields from city connections to +2.
- Sacred Sites now adds +2 Faith to Worship Centers (Cathedral, Divinity School, Dojo, Garden, Holy Fortress, Pyramid).
- Strength of the Earth no longer adds Production to anything except the Mining Pit ancient wonder.
- Unity of the Sages' old effect has been thrown out; it's now Rekmod's Unity of the Prophets (+4 Faith, +2 Production to Seminaries + replacements) instead of Simultaneum from Civ 6.

**Policy Adjustments**
- Adaptation:
	- Castle Doctrine buffed to +1 Happiness per 10 population, though it still requires a garrison.
	- Centralization's Production bonus to building construction in the capital buffed to 15%.
	- Planned Economy renamed to Endurance Programme and reduced to a 25% Water bonus, but it also adds +1 of the respective yield to active Farmers, Engineers and Merchants.
	- The finisher bonus no longer requires a garrison for the bonus Food/Growth.
- Sovereignty:
	- Doctrine buffed to add +2 Water to Barracks, fully matching Rekmod's buff. Because yes, war economy is best economy.
	- Autocracy renamed to Security Forces.
	- Military Tradition no longer grants its XP bonus to Aircraft.
- Theocracy:
	- Divine Mandate now lowers the Faith cost of unit/building purchase (instead of waiting until the finisher bonus).
	- The free Great Sage from Apotheosis has been moved to the finisher bonus after testing demonstrated that placing it here made it available much too early (allowing factions to consistently found a religion in the first 20 turns of the game). Apotheosis instead awards a free Golden Age and keeps the policy cost reduction effect.
	- Exodus of the Evangelists' added Faith yields to the Grand Monastery reduced to a fixed +4. The bonus belief from the finisher bonus has been moved here. Additionally, it no longer requires Indulgences, but still requires Organized Religion.
	- The finisher bonus no longer adds Faith yields to Seminaries and their replacements. The added Culture has been increased to +3.
- Rationalism:
	- Technocracy no longer adds Science to the Council.
	- Sample Analysis now adds +1 Science to all Refineries.
	- Skepticism renamed to New Pioneers. (Educated Elite will be renamed later.)

- Supremacy:
	- Police State now cuts the construction time of Prison Camps and Work Camps in half.
	- The finisher bonus is reduced to a 15% combat bonus, but remains in effect for the entire game once adopted. With the adjustments to Crystal Refinery yields, it now adds +4 Science to them instead of +2 Water/Science.
- Monopoly:
	- Increased priority for AI factions that prefer Diplomatic Victory.
	- The opener now adds +1 Culture to Markets and increases the bonus to Great Merchant generation by 33%.
	- Mass Consumption now adds +1 Gold to all Refineries.
	- Enterpreneurship nerfed to 25% maintenance cost reduction on infrastructure.
	- The finisher bonus now boosts the yields of Narcotics farms (+2 Water/Culture), but no longer adds yields to Settlements (since Great Merchants no longer create them) and only adds +1 Food/Production to Wasteland Stations. Also, it awards a free Great Merchant.

	- The opener now increases the bonus to Great Engineer generation by 33% and unlocks access to a new unit.
	- Political Officers no longer boosts the production speed of Aircraft.
	- Shared Vision's Production bonus to the Council reduced to 15%, but it now adds an additional +5% Production bonus to Factories.
	- Workers' Union no longer adds flat Production to your cities.

	- The finisher bonus no longer adds Global Happiness.
- Naturalism:
	- Emissions Standards now boosts the yields of Solar collectors and Wind farms the same way Weather Engineering does (+2 Production, +1 Power).
	- Ecodefense reverted to a 10% Strength bonus. However, it now unlocks access to a new unit and awards three of them for free.
	- Conservation now adds 10% to the total Water yields of cities with a Rainwater Purifier instead of a flat +2 to that building.

	- Urbanization no longer increases Science.
	- Digitization adjusted to +2 Culture/Happiness and no Faith for Data/Decryption Centers.
	- The finisher no longer gives a free Purge Robot (this was very...unbalanced) and now gives two free Great People like the other ideologies, in this case 1 Engineer and 1 Scientist. The extra strategic resources is increased to 50% to match the base scenario.
- Bionics:
	- Increased priority for AI factions that prefer Science Victory. Priority for AI factions that prefer Culture Victory reduced to 0.
	- Eugenics now only grants extra starting XP to Personnel units, but it grants them 25 XP. (When combined with Total War, this allows Personnel trained in the city that owns the Military Academy for every faction that isn't locked out of Supremacy, sans Enclavers, to start with a minimum of 4 promotions.) Additionally, the +2 Faith from having 2 active specialists is now +2 Happiness.
	- Transhumanism no longer reduces the cost of Faith purchases.
	- The bonus to Utopia Project construction speed has been moved to Naturalism's finisher. It now gives a bonus towards the Biosphere and Colony Ship projects.

- The Reconnaissance promotion line is nerfed as follows:
	- Level 1 no longer awards bonus XP from combat.
	- Level 2 no longer gives extra movement or removes the movement cost of pillaging tiles; it now has the Ignore Zone of Control promotion and bonus against Siege units that was part of Level 3.
	- Level 3 is now just +1 movement.
- Shock, Pursuit, and Loose Formation are no longer available for Scrapper units. Pursuit is now available for Armor units, but it is nerfed to remove the unit healing on killing units.

- Sea Raider buffed to grant a combat bonus against wounded units and allow the ship to heal 25 HP for each kill.
- AI Implant nerfed to remove the Strength bonus when attacking.

**Resource Adjustments**
- Hexlock's Chemicals are now Strategic Resources as they should be according to Hexlock's UA instead of Luxury Resources. Hexlock now actually suffers from early-game Happiness issues as intended.
- Scriptures no longer have any stat yields on their own.

**Tile Improvement Adjustments**
- In general, most Great Improvements now benefit from improved stat scaling.
- Academies now gain +3 Science instead of +2 from the relevant techs. The first +3 now comes at Laboratory instead of Electronics.
- Artificial oases are now available earlier at Land Remediation and can be built on Desert Swamps (gaining an additional +1 Food/Water if built on those tiles). However, the Water they award enemy factions for pillaging is doubled.
- Crystal Refineries now start at +4 Science but their adjacency bonuses are nerfed; they now gain +2 Science, +1 Water with 3 or less adjacent Refineries, increasing to +4 Science, +2 Water with 4 or more. Their Production gains are also reduced, only gaining +2 from Coal or Oil tiles.
- Drydocks now start at +4 Production and gain a total of +6 Production/Science from tech progression.
- Endowment Houses are adjusted as follows: Start at +6 Faith, gain an additional +1 Water/Culture/Faith from tech progression, but only gain +1 Food from having adjacent food sources (instead of +1 Food for each adjacent food source).
- Food source improvements no longer add extra Food (or remove Water yields) when built on fresh water tiles. Artificial oases, which were buffed to add both Food and Water on those tiles, are exempt from this nerf.
	- Grasslands nerfed further to remove the adjacency bonuses from Tree plantations and Artificial oases entirely.
- Hexlock's standard Refineries have had their adjacency bonuses reduced by 1, but gain +1 to their respective yield at Laboratory and at Advanced Materials.
	- VX Refinery now adds Food instead of Faith.
- Manufactories now start at +4 Production and scale to +12 from tech progression, along with +2 Food/Science. However, the stat buff at Electronics has been pushed back to Advanced Materials.
- Narcotics farms now start at +2 Water, +4 Culture and gain an additional +2 Water with Hydroponics and +4 Culture with Social Engineering.
- Oracles now start at +6 Faith and gain +2 Culture with Chemistry, but no longer provide Happiness.
- Outposts are adjusted to gain their +4 Production bonus from researching Combined Arms instead of building atop Strategic Resources.
- Prison farms gain an additional +4 Production with Social Engineering.
- Seminaries now start at +4 Faith, increasing to +6 with Education, but no longer provide any Culture on their own.
- Settlements are now exclusively a Great Administrator improvement and only provide Culture yields, starting at +4 and increasing by another +4 from tech scaling.
- Tree plantations now gain their last stat boost at Atmosphere Remediation instead of Geo Engineering.
- Water pumps buffed to +4 base Water, +2 gained at Decontamination. Until the gold-to-science slider is removed from the base mod, I don't dare buff this improvement any further.
- Wasteland Stations now start at +2 Food/Water instead of the original +1 Food/Water, +1 from Currency, given that the Harbingers start with that tech so that particular bit of stat scaling is pointless. They no longer gain Food from adjacent Food source tiles, but are buffed to receive an extra +1 Food/Production and +2 Gold from tech scaling.
