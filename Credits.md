# Credits

Like the status of the mod as a whole as well as DeCiv Redux's credit list, this is incomplete.<br>
Pixel art will most likely reuse other sources (several of them from DeCiv, Drydock from Rekmod) for the initial upload.<br>
Floating Settlements and Wasteland Stations borrow the Biodome City and Mining Camp images from Alpha Frontier, with permission from [Indonesian Gentleman](https://github.com/carriontrooper).<br>
Preservator is borrowed from [Bamboolord](https://github.com/RealBamboolord) with his permission.<br>
Several icons reuse images used in either Unciv or DeCiv Redux, with some of the latter remaining unsourced.<br>
The Religion Icons for Anglicanism, Imperial Cult and Mormonism were created by Tomatekh on CivFanatics and can be found [at the Civ 5 Customization Wiki's entry on the Tomatekh's Historical Religions mod](https://civilization-v-customisation.fandom.com/wiki/Tomatekh%27s_Historical_Religions).<br>
The icons for Alma Frontier Guard and Alma State Guard are of my own creation.

Unless otherwise specified, all of the following are from the Noun Project, licensed under Creative Commons or Public Domain. Also, if anyone feels like there is a better/more fitting icon out there for any particular building/unit/etc. than the one that is used, I am open to suggestions for replacement icons.

Items still missing an icon (not necessarily a complete list): Arsenal of Liberty, Condenser Cooler, Defense Directorate (and its replacements), Exploratores, Field Preparations Squad, Ignitor's Tower, Issaquah Mystic, Mounted Railgun, Pax Observer, Pax Surveyor, Preservator (icon also missing from TCC-beta), Pridwen-class, Rapid Response Squad, Research and Preservation Institute, Sharashka, SS Casing, SS Life Support, State Guard, Super Mutant, Zemlyanka
