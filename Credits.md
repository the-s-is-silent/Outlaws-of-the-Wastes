# Credits

Like the status of the mod as a whole as well as DeCiv Redux's credit list, this is incomplete.<br>
Pixel art will most likely reuse other sources (several of them from DeCiv, Caer and Drydock from Rekmod, Barbarian Scout and Suicider from The Barbarians) for the initial upload.<br>
Several unit sprites are either borrowed from, or based off sprites made by, [The Bucketeer](https://github.com/GeneralWadaling).
The sprites for Eagle Warrior, War Tram, and Armored Train were made by [ReallyBasicName](https://github.com/ReallyBasicName).<br>
Armed Mining Camp, Cactus and Cactus Farm, Floating Settlement, Fortified Farm, Supply Complex, and Wasteland Station borrow and in some cases modify tile images from Alpha Frontier, with permission from [Indonesian Gentleman](https://github.com/carriontrooper).<br>
Preservator is borrowed from [Bamboolord](https://github.com/RealBamboolord) with his permission.<br>
Several icons reuse images used in Unciv, DeCiv Redux, Civ 6 mod, and Rekmod, with some of the latter three remaining unsourced.<br>
The Religion Icons for Anglicanism, Imperial Cult and Mormonism were created by Tomatekh on CivFanatics and can be found [at the Civ 5 Customization Wiki's entry on the Tomatekh's Historical Religions mod](https://civilization-v-customisation.fandom.com/wiki/Tomatekh%27s_Historical_Religions).<br>
The icons for Alma Frontier Guard and Alma State Guard are of my own creation.

Unless otherwise specified, all of the following icons are from the Noun Project, licensed under Creative Commons or Public Domain. Also, if anyone feels like there is a better/more fitting icon out there for any particular building/unit/etc. than the one that is used, I am open to suggestions for replacement icons.

Items still missing an icon (not necessarily a complete list): Amoxcalli, Calmecac, Calpulli, Condenser Cooler, Defense Directorate (and its replacements), Defiant Guardian, Defiant Scout, Killdozer, Mounted Railgun, Pale Veteran, Pax Observer, Pax Researcher, Pax Surveyor, Persevering Pax Researcher, Pithouse, Praetorium, Preservator (icon also missing from TCC-beta), Pridwen-class, Roller, SS Casing, SS Life Support, Super Mutant, Telpochcalli, Tiyanquitzli, Weaponized Yacht
