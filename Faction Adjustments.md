## List of changes to DeCiv Redux's base 14 factions:

#### Atlas
- They are given a Mountain start bias and are now forbidden from building Enslaved units, Prison Camps and Work Camps.
- All of their Melee Personnel units (except Mounted units) now inherit the Surveyor ability promotion regardless of whether or not they upgraded from a Surveyor.
- The unnecessary and nonsensical double production speed towards their unique Electrostatic Generators was removed.
- They no longer have any starting techs or Science penalty.
- The free Great Scientist from their UA has been pushed back from Secrets of the Past to Education, and the only Great People they generate faster with their UA are Great Scientists, which are earned 30% faster (increased to 50% from retaining free Rationalism policy).
- Atlas Refuge no longer has a Scientist slot, but adds 60 City HP (up from 40), 5 City Strength and 1 base point of Science.
- Survey Center now adds +3 Science, +1 Culture, and increases to +8 Science, +3 Culture at Flight.

- New UBs:
  - Kruger Line (standalone national wonder, unlocks at Railroads, requires Factories in every city, consumes Power, adds +3 Culture to the capital, +1 Production to tiles with Railroads and +1 Water per Trade Route)

- TODO: Add at least one new UU and one more UB based on the source material

#### Blackwarden

- Operations Center now costs 150 Production.
- Personnel Offices now cost 160 Production and no longer gain bonuses from owning Slaves. However, they regain the standard Town Hall's Administrator slot, reduce tile purchase costs by 25%, and add a +10% Production boost for Personnel units.
- Resource Management Servers have a harsher limit (2 vs. base scenario's 5, but all Monopoly policy buildings have this limit now) and no longer boost city growth or provide Slaves, but to compensate, they give +10% Water to the two cities that can own one.
- New UB: Private School (restored cut content from older versions of DeCiv - replaces Public School, no maintenance, +2 Water, additional +2 Water for each Scientist active in the city)

#### Children of Rust
- They no longer start with Redomestication, and the Faith bonus only applies with *unimproved* Ruins tiles.
- The Longhouse wonder is replaced with First Kiva, which adds +40 more City HP (at the cost of losing the measly +1 to City Strength) and a bonus Pantheon belief upon founding their religion. However, it does not generate any Faith on its own until a Pantheon has been founded, and it gives their new Food Store replacement instead of a Salvage Yard.
- Salvage Yards no longer add Production to Scrap resources; they regain the normal Forge's Production bonus towards Land units.
- Communes are no longer available at the start of the game and no longer reduce tile cost purchase or have any base yields without access to Power. Also, they cost 120 Production (up from 40). However, they add +2 Food with access to Power.

- Defense Committee only adds a 10% unit production bonus (down from 20%).

- Auxiliaries, which were previously early-game Enslaved units available to every faction except Commonwealth and New Star, are now Legion exclusive, no longer Enslaved units, and replace Militia, lacking the Weapons requirement and retaining the infrastructure building properties but taking a hit in combat strength compared to standard Militia (30 vs. 36). Instead of a 50% combat bonus against Mounted units, they gain a 15% combat bonus while adjacent to another Melee unit.
- Legions now have the same combat strength as standard Militia, but lose their combat bonus against cities.

- The Senate now adds a +15% Production boost to cities constructing buildings which are owned in the capital.
- The Consulate now doubles the recovery rate of lost CS influence - this is a placeholder buff until BNW content is implemented in Unciv and Gunboat Diplomacy becomes a thing. However, the Production bonus towards Military units now only applies to Land units and is reduced to 15%.
- Military Schools no longer inflict a Food penalty. However, the Production bonus towards Military units now only applies to Land units and is reduced to 10%.

#### Cult of Ignis
- Armor units gain +1 Movement from their UA.
- Coal Plants no longer boost Culture.
- Strategic resources no longer have added Faith yields.
- Oracles start at +6 Faith, gain +2 Culture after researching Chemistry, and no longer provide Happiness.
- The Temple is *severely* nerfed; it no longer generates Faith on Turn 1, no longer provides Local Happiness, no longer adds an Administrator slot, and no longer grants an instant Pantheon (which was formerly a guaranteed Turn 1 Religion via free Great Prophet prior to them being nerfed in the base scenario). To compensate, it adds +1 Culture/Faith to active Administrators.
- Fuel Depots are also nerfed: they only add +1 Culture to Oil tiles.
- Plantations have been taken from them and given to Deadrock Clan as a Greenhouse replacement (and are nerfed).

- Initiate Schools are nerfed: they lose the added Science yields to Rubble/Ruins and the extra starting XP to new units is only granted to Armor units. However, they add +1 Culture/Faith while the faction has Power.
- Arena now replaces Stadium and loses the extra point of Culture/Happiness while the player possesses extra Slaves. Additionally, the starting XP bonus is restricted to Armor units. The new condition for benefiting from additional Happiness past the base +2 is to be at war.
- War Council's Production boost only applies to Armor units. It now adds a 5% Unhappiness reduction in all cities, but the player has to be at war for it to apply.
- Seer Council's old effect has been thrown out. It now gains the standard 10% Council growth bonus, and adds +2 Culture to every owned Fuel Depot and College of Mystics and a +50% Production boost towards Faith buildings.
- New UBs:
  - Ignitor's Tower (new Town Hall replacement, retains the 75% boost to Worker training speed but adds 50 City HP instead of 20% total Food, +2 Production with extra Slaves instead of +2 Food, and +1 Culture/Faith with Books access)
  - Fortified Aquifer (replaces Water Storage, +2 City Strength, +50 City HP, +1 Food/Water to worked Mountain tiles)

They now unlock at Botany instead of being available at the start of the game, lose the 20% total Food bonus, regain the standard Greenhouse boosts to Food (+2 to the city itself, +1 to Farm-able resources, +1 Farmer slot), and only give a 50% boost to Worker training speed. They also add +1 Food to active Farmers in the city and +1 Culture to worked Narcotics farm tiles. Because of the Slave consumption requirement, they're 30% cheaper to build than standard Greenhouses.
- Salvage Exchange has been removed from the game on account of being too similar to Children of Rust's Salvage Yard with no feasible way to differentiate the two.
- Information Markets add +1 Water while the faction has Power and no longer have reduced Science gain compared to standard Libraries, but also no longer give Great Scientist Points.

#### Hexlock
- They start with fewer free techs now: knowledge of Chemistry is gained, but knowledge of all of their previous starting techs except for Writing is lost. However, the malus on GP generation is removed, Encrypted Data resources are doubled, and they receive a 15% construction speed bonus towards National Wonders.
- Chemicals are now properly Strategic Resources instead of Luxury Resources, so now Hexlock actually has Happiness issues.
- All five of the original chemicals from the base scenario have been condensed into a single resource.
- Field Scientists and Purge Robots are now standalone units.
- Purge Robot Proto's base Strength increased from 25 to 40, in order to give Hexlock a fighting chance. But its Production cost is increased from 50 to 75.

The VX Refinery now provides Food instead of Faith, but is not considered a Food source improvement.
- Crystal Refineries have their base yields doubled to +4 Science, +2 Water, but have their adjacency bonuses reduced to +2 Science, +1 Water with 3 or less adjacent Refineries, +4 Science, +2 Water with 4 or more. They now provide a Refined version of the consolidated Experimented Chemical that *is* allowed to be a Luxury. Also, they gain +2 Production and provide an extra copy of Coal or Oil if built on the respective resource tile.
- Compound Mixes now cost 2 of the consolidated unique resource (aside from Meltdown which consumes 1 copy of the Refined version) and require the city to work the Refinery which corresponds with the chemical that Refinery originally produced.
- Compound Mix GP replaced with Compound Mix GF, generating Great Farmers instead of Great Sages.
- Heat Plants are no longer one of their unique components and can be built by everyone.
- Pre-Med Labs have been buffed to carry over the same amount of Food on population increase as the Hospitals they replace and add +1 Food to VX Refineries, increasing to +2 in the late game.
- Experiment on Survivors now awards a Field Scientist instead of a Great Scientist, gives +2 pop in the capital instead of +1 in all cities, and can only be built in the capital.
- Private Labels no longer add Science to Refineries, but have a base yield of +3 Water.
- Record Grids now add +1 Science to Refineries, +1 Local Happiness while the faction has Power, and lose both the increase to Production cost and reduced Science per pop compared to the Libraries they replace.

  - Hexlock Chemical Company (replaces Food Processing Plant, adds +2 Production/Water to all Refinery improvements and +2 Production to worked Salt tiles instead of boosting Food yields, and grants the unique Self-Repair promotion to Purge Robots)
  - Chemfuel Generator (standalone, requires a worked Refinery of any type and an Experimental Lab, boosts city Production by 5% and provides 2 units of Power, will be destroyed if the city is captured)

#### The Mariners
- They now start with Rediscovery adopted, and upon adopting Advanced Piracy *all* of their Water units along with their Personnel units gain the policy's Sea Raider promotion.
- The Great Lighthouse buffed to add +2 Food to the capital provided it's actually founded on the coast. It no longer generates Faith, however.

#### New Star
- They lose the absurd 50% boost to GP generation, but gain a form of their planned UA for the Rebirth Edition: Civilian and Support units receive Thermoptic Camouflage, and gifting these units to City-States nets 15 Influence with them. The Strength bonus for Wounded units now applies evenly, and the Sight bonus for Wounded units is extended to the other Support units.
