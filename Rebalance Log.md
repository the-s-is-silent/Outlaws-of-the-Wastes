Here is a comprehensive list of every change that was made to a unit, building, wonder, policy, belief, etc. in the base scenario (excluding faction unique components and Great Improvements only created by faction unique components, but including one city-state unique component):

Tech Changes:
- Electronics is now required for both Computers and Radar; the latter adjustment prevents players from skipping the Rebuilding era.
- Biology no longer boosts city growth.
- Computers no longer boosts Production or Science.
- Nuclear Fission has been renamed to Nuclear Power.

City-State Quest Changes:
- All available quests are now weighted with certain CS type being less or more likely to give certain quests.
- Clear Barbarian Camp can no longer be given. This is for two reasons:
	1) A bug that is also present in official Civ 5 where using a mod to enable Barbarian Camps to award ruins bonuses prevents this quest from being completed.
	2) Even without that bug, the City-States in DeCiv are powerful enough to be capable of clearing the camp they ask the player to clear before the player can do so.
- The duration of Contest Culture/Faith/Technologies is reduced by 20%.

Ruins Changes:
- The base rate of camp spawns is 2x higher than in the base scenario.
- Survivor camps cannot award free Workers, Civilian Convoys, or unit upgrades on any difficulty.
- Each individual ruins bonus is weighted and while a few that also exist in the base scenario have been buffed, several of these bonuses have been made inaccessible during the earliest turns of the game.

Unit Changes:
- Nuclear weapons can no longer be purchased.
- Terraformer Part production cost is doubled.
- Ancient Armor is now a standalone UU for Almaty, and its strength has been reduced to 50. This gives players a chance to fight back in the early-game against enemy factions who either allied with or conquered Almaty or have the Army Depot in their possession.
- Ancient Armor also gains some buffs, however: base movement increased to 5 with another point added when starting its turn in friendly territory, and no combat penalty for attacking across rivers. Also, its Production cost is reduced from 200 to 150.
- Attack Boats (and the Mariners' replacement) no longer require Factories to build, so they're now properly available at Steam Power instead of being forced to wait until Manufacturing. They can now also spawn as Barbarian units.
- Machine Guns are now Shooter units with the Personnel modifier, and start with Logistics.
- Scouts (and New Star's replacement) now upgrade to Forward Observers instead of Gunmen. Also, Forward Observers cannot be used to capture cities.
- Tanks can now appear as Barbarian units (the Barbarian version is the Killdozer which is available earlier for them and doesn't spend movement points to pillage).

Building Changes:
- Defensive buildings are no longer all automatically unlocked by building Walls and must now be built in order: Hardened Defenses requires Defensive Emplacements, Battery and Bunker require Hardened Defenses, and Active Denial System requires Battery.
- Ally with Isolationists is now a National Wonder, addressing an issue where it could still be purchased if Annex Isolationists was built first. Its added yields to the Isolated Island are increased to +3 Water/Science and +2 Culture, and it adds +2 Happiness to the owning city.
- Nuclear Waste Museum is now a National Wonder, addressing an issue where it could still be purchased if Excavate Nuclear Waste was built first. It also adds 10% Science and Culture to its city, adding incentive to build it, along with an additional +3 Science and +1 Culture to the ancient wonder tile.
- Listening Post (and relevant replacements) nerfed to 25% GP generation with no extra bonus for Constitution factions.
- The four Monopoly buildings no longer have a Production malus and instead grant extra stats as follows:
	- Content Farm (and replacements): +3 Science, but no longer adds Culture
	- Electronics Production Line: -10% Unhappiness from population in the owning city
	- Machinery Production Line: +10% Production
	- Publishing House: +2 Culture
	- However, they now have a civ-wide limit of 2 each and you cannot have more than one of the four in the same city, and they will shut down when the faction runs out of Power instead of still functioning until falling into negative Power. Content Farms also unlock at Networking and require Data Centers instead of Broadcast Towers.
- Arcology Dome buffed to +250 City HP and +33% Water, but requires the city to be of size 20 or higher.
- Government building adjustments:
	- All Congress variants that reduce Unhappiness have their potency reduced by half.
	- All Council variants are increased to a minimum production cost of 100.
- Industry building adjustments:
	- Aluminum Smelter no longer adds a Food/Water penalty to Aluminum tiles and restores the commented out +3 Production to the city, and also adds an Engineer slot.
	- Armament Production Line, Armor Production Line, and Aerospace Facility no longer reduce the city's Production when not building their specific units. However, they now each have a maintenance cost of 3 Water per turn.
		- Armor Production Line now only adds a 33% Production bonus towards Armor units (that will shut off if the faction runs out of Power) and no longer awards a free Tank upon acquisition; however, building it gives Armor units access to a new promotion improving their defensive abilities.
	- Bio Synthesizer is available earlier (at Plastics Recycling instead of Atmosphere Remediation) and provides 2 Oil, but no Aluminum or Uranium. You can have up to 5 now instead of 3, but it costs 1000 Production to build.
	- Blast Furnace nerfed to +1 Production on Scrap/Metal tiles, but no longer adds Food/Water penalties to them.
	- Carbon Capture *severely* nerfed; instead of adding Food/Happiness to Grasslands, it adds +1 Production to Tree plantations. Additionally, its maintenance cost is increased by 1 and it consumes Power.
	- Heat Plant is now available later at Plastics, but is buffed to provide 4 Power.
	- Metal Reprocessor now provides 2 Aluminum.
	- Nuclear Plant (and replacements) buffed to provide 16 Power.
	- Oil Plant buffed to provide 8 Power (2 by default, 2 if the owner still has spare Oil, 4 from tech progression) and remove the Food/Water penalty, and it gains an Engineer slot. However, it no longer adds yields to Oil tiles and cannot exist in the same city as a Nuclear Plant.
	- Oil Refinery no longer adds a Food/Water penalty to Oil tiles and gains an Engineer slot, and provides an additional copy of Oil upon researching Advanced Materials. However, it only adds +2 Production instead of +3 to Oil tiles.
	- Plastics Factory buffed to add +1 Production to Plastics tiles and +2 Production to Oil tiles worked by the city.
	- Plastics Reprocessor has been removed from the game.
	- Prison Camp (and replacements) now costs 60 Production (previously 20) and is additionally more expensive to purchase with Water. However, the standard Camps no longer have a Food penalty.
	- Recycling Plant is now a Production building instead of a Power Plant building. It adds +4 base Production, +15% to the city's total Production yields, +1 Production to worked Scrap, Metal, Plastics, and Strategic resource tiles, and 1 Engineer slot, and consumes Power to build. This coupled with the Plastics Reprocessor deletion is because it made absolutely no sense for the Recycling Plant to be a Power Plant.
	- Stable nerfed to +1 Production on Horses tiles, but no longer adds a Food penalty to them.
	- Transport Network *severely* nerfed; it now only adds +1 Production to Borough tiles and no additional stats.
	- Uranium Centrifuge nerfed: you can only have 3 instead of 5 and they have to be in cities with a Nuclear Plant.
- Food/Growth building adjustments:
	- Ranches can now be built with improved Horses tiles in the city radius and they add +1 Food to those tiles along with +1 Farmer slot.
	- Hospitals (and relevant replacements), Medical Labs, and Organ Labs have had their minor Science penalty removed (a penalty they shouldn't have had in the first place). Hospitals also *ignore* the difficulty update that shuts down their food preservation effect when the faction falls into negative Power.
- Water building adjustments:
	- Market (and replacements) have a Merchant slot moved to Water Storage, but those that didn't have a base Water yield on the building itself gain 1 Water in compensation.
	- Water Plant gains a Merchant slot and +2 Water.
	- Greywater Treatment Plant loses the Production penalties, but also loses its single point of Food yield and one point of base Water yield.
	- Rainwater Purifier adds an additional +15% to the city's total Water yields, making it more useful than it originally was.
- Science building adjustments:
	- Library (and replacements) add +2 Science to Books tiles instead of +1 Science, +1 Culture.
	- University (and replacements) add +2 Science instead of +1 while the faction has access to Power.
	- Public School (and replacements) no longer add Culture and count every 2 population instead of every 3 for their scaling Science boost.
	- Data Center severely nerfed; it only adds +5 Science instead of +50% to the city's total Science yields (Hexlock's replacement adds +8 base instead of +65% total), and no longer adds Culture to Data and Encrypted Data tiles, adding +2 Science instead of +1 to those tiles.
- Culture building adjustments:
	- Broadcast Tower now gives +2 Culture, no Happiness, and costs 3 Water per turn in maintenance.
	- Television Studio now gives +2 Culture/Happiness and costs 2 Water per turn in maintenance.

Wonder Changes
(Several of these are mostly due to Wonders not obeying their proper behavior - in Unciv, they *can* be rebuilt after razing the city they're in, which should not be possible. However, it is unlikely I will revert most of the nerfs to wonders that were made because of this bug enabling exploits with the old effects.)
- Wincon wonders, International Trade Center, and Manhattan Project can no longer have their production hurried.
	- International Trade Center is buffed, however: it adds +5 Water, +50% to the owning city's total Water yields, and +3 Water to city connections.
- Salvage Tank Depot now awards an Ancient Armor instead of a Tank (it originally awarded a Modern Armor in the base scenario prior to an "increased difficulty" update).
- Salvage Army Depot replaced with Restore Army Depot, which costs 5x more Production (era-based 250 vs. 50), awards an Ancient Armor instead of a Tank (Modern Armor prior to the "increased difficulty" update), adds +25% Production towards Armor units in the owning city, and adds an extra +3 Production to the Army Depot tile.
- Salvage Space Station nerfed to remove its free Technology, due to the above exploit, which would have allowed players to gain several free Technologies by razing and rebuilding non-capital cities next to its ancient wonder. Instead it adds +4 extra Science, +2 Culture and +2 Production to that wonder's tile along with 20% more Science and 2 Great Scientist Points in the city that owns it.
- Faust Project adjusted in almost the exact same way due to that same exploit, but without the added Culture points to its ancient wonder; instead it provides 3 additional copies of Uranium. Its Production cost is also increased to the era-default 185 (Standard speed).
- Open the Vault nerfed to remove its free Great Sage due to that same exploit, but adds +2 Science and an extra +1 Culture/Faith to the Vault of Records tile. The free Sage will be restored once World Wonders start obeying their proper behavior.
- Mining Operation buffed to add an extra Production point to the Mining Pit and 15% total Production to the city that owns it.
- Pit of Sacrifice nerfed to remove its free Pantheon Effect due to that same exploit along with adding a minor Food penalty (-1 to the Mining Pit tile instead of +1), but to compensate, it gives 25% more Faith to that city. This nerf will be reverted once World Wonders start obeying their proper behavior.
- The Last Paradise buffed to add +3 Culture/Happiness to the Oasis instead of +1, along with 10% more Water to the city that owns it, and +1 Food, Water, Culture and Happiness to Artificial Oases once those become available.
- Distribute Soft Drinks and Fist of God have been removed from the game.
- Annex Isolationists adjusted as follows:
	- +5 Production to the Isolated Island tile instead of +5 Water
	- 2 Weapons/Slaves provided instead of 1
	- -1 Culture penalty to the Isolated Island tile moved to the wonder itself
	- Happiness penalty increased to -2
	- +1 population upon completion
- Produce Soft Drinks buffed to add +2 extra Culture and Happiness to the Soft Drinks Factory tile.
- Salvage Graveyard buffed to add an extra +1 Production/Science to the Ship Graveyard tiles, an extra copy of Oil and an extra free Patrol Boat.
- Turbine Hall buffed to add +2 Production/Water and +1 Science to the Hydroelectric Dam tile, an extra 4 Power upon discovering Computers, and an extra +20% Production to the owning city.
- Heavy Equipment's production cost reduced to 150 (was previously a much, much too high 400) and the project is buffed to award 2 free Workers and add +3 Production to the city it's built in.
- Domestic Electrification's production cost reduced to a flat 150, no longer scaling upward based on the number of owned cities (among wonders that had their production cost set too high, this was by far the worst offender, at an obscenely high *400 base + 50 extra per owned city*). However, it no longer works nearly as well for tall factions; it now adds a flat +1 Culture to the capital and an additional +1 Culture/Happiness to all cities connected to the capital while the faction has Power, instead of a potential +8 Happiness to the capital.
- Public Broadcast's production cost increased to 500 (was previously a much, much too low 100) and it now requires every non-puppeted city you control to have a Broadcast Tower, not just the city it's built in. However, it also adds +3 Culture to the city it's built in.
- Broadcast Network now requires every city to have a Television Studio, instead of only needing one in the city it's built in. Its Production cost is reduced to 400 base + 30 per owned city.
- National College and Grand Monastery's base production cost reduced to 125 + 30 extra per owned city (were previously much, much too high, at 300/400 respectively).
- Medical Network now requires a Hospital in every city instead of a minimum of 4 cities, and its base production cost is reduced to 150 (was previously 400) + 30 extra per owned city.
- Public Works Administration only awards one Golden Age now instead of a potential permanent Golden Age. It also loses its one measly Science point, but adds an extra Production point to all cities that are connected to the capital. Prior to this nerf, it was inarguably the most overpowered wonder in the base scenario. However, like many other National Wonders its Production cost has been reduced, to 150 base + 30 per owned city. (Note: The base scenario has since implemented a much more severe nerf that makes it effectively worthless: a mere +20 Culture per friendship declaration/defensive pact signing - so the PWA is actually *stronger* now in this mod than in the base scenario.)
- Ground Control Center now costs 300 Production (was originally 920). It along with all faction specific replacements now add Culture instead of Happiness.
- Media Center is now a normal building instead of a National Wonder and can also be built in cities with worked Books tiles, adding +2 Culture to those tiles. It also adds an Administrator slot instead of Great Administrator Points.
- Fusion Reactor's cost has been reduced and its effects are drastically buffed: it now doubles the owning faction's Power supply and adds +8 Production, +25% Production to all cities. However, the capital must own a Nuclear Plant.

Policy Changes:
- The policy tree has been overhauled, borrowing heavily from Rekmod with some thematic deviations to make it feel a bit more like a BNW-style expansion.
	- One new policy tree, Rediscovery, has been added, available starting from the second technological era.
	- Growth bonuses in general are *severely* nerfed, denying an absurd advantage that going Adaptation-Constitution once provided.
	- Adaptation:
		- Castle Doctrine no longer adds +25% city strength to defensive buildings (this bonus has been moved to the Homeland Defense Initiative national wonder), but receives part of the old finisher bonus and gives free Walls in your first 4 cities. It also adds +1 Happiness per 10 population in all of your cities and does not require a garrison for this bonus.
		- Differential Rationing's bonus was moved all the way back to Harmony and it now receives Centralization's effect.
		- Centralization now requires Differential Rationing and adds +1 Culture to every specialist in the capital and +10% Production towards building construction in the capital.
		- Parallel Markets now only requires Centralization.
		- Planned Economy replaced with Endurance Programme, which adds +25% Water to the Council and +1 of the respective yields to active Farmers, Engineers and Merchants.
		- The finisher bonus is buffed to a +15% growth bonus and allows purchasing Great Farmers with Faith (moved here from Naturalism's finisher).
	- Expansionism
		- The opener is buffed to reduce the Water cost of tile purchases by 25%.
		- Citizen Militia and Courier Service have been swapped in the tree; the former policy is also buffed to award a free Worker.
	- Sovereignty
		- The opener bonus loses the Culture from Barbarian kills and gains Doctrine's old Culture per kill bonus against all Military units.
        - Discipline loses its old effect completely and now boosts unit production by 20%.
        - Doctrine now starts the war economy earlier than before; the Culture per kill becomes Water per kill, and it adds yields to the Barracks (+2 Production/Water/Culture).
        - Autocracy adjusted to award +2 Culture, +3 Happiness from garrisoned units and move the double Slaves bonus to Spoils of War.
        - Military Tradition's bonus of double military unit gift rate from Military CS while allies at war is moved to the finisher bonus and it now gives a 10% Strength bonus to Land units.
        - Triumph receives the old finisher of reduced upgrade costs.
        - The finisher bonus now awards Science per kill (25% of unit's cost), the free Great General that was originally awarded by Discipline, the boosted unit gift rate that was originally provided by Military Tradition, and allows purchasing Great Generals with Faith (moved here from Supremacy's finisher).
	- Theocracy
		- Can now be taken alongside Rationalism, and is available at the start of the game.
		- The opener bonus is buffed to add +1 Culture/Faith to the capital.
		- Organized Religion buffed to remove the Science penalty from Faith buildings and add a Happiness bonus to those buildings instead.
		- Indulgences buffed to +25% Water bonus from Monasteries and adds +1 Water to the main three Faith buildings and +2 Water to Seminaries + replacements (the latter was moved here from the finisher bonus).
		- Mandate of Heaven, God Emperor, and Holy Scriptures are removed, with the aim of decoupling this policy from Supremacy by making it less warlike.
		- Divine Mandate replaces Mandate of Heaven, adding +2 Culture/Happiness to Monuments.
		- Apotheosis replaces God Emperor, reducing the Culture cost of adopting additional Policies by 10% and triggering an instant Golden Age upon adoption.
		- Exodus of the Evangelists replaces Holy Scriptures, adding +2 Movement to Religious Units, +4 Faith to the Grand Monastery, and a free Enhancer Belief (moved here from the finisher bonuses).
		- The finisher bonus no longer adds extra Faith to Seminaries + replacements, but adds +1 Food and +3 Culture to those improvements, and awards a free Great Sage.
    - Rationalism
        - Can now be taken alongside Theocracy.
		- In general, the tree gives less Science, but is deliberately not as severely nerfed as it is in Rekmod (which nerfs it to the point of making it a legitimately bad policy tree...though this mod does come fairly close to nerfing it that much).
        - The opener bonus loses the extra Science from Research Agreements.
        - Technocracy is now an entry level policy for the tree and is nerfed to remove the Science bonus to the Council.
		- Skepticism renamed to New Pioneers and buffed to remove the Faith penalty from Science buildings and add +1 Science to those buildings, but it now requires Technocracy.
		- Sample Analysis now requires Equipment Upgrades.
		- Equipment Upgrades loses its old effects and boosts Science building production, making the policy less warlike. This policy will be renamed later to reflect its new effect.
		- Educated Elite now requires New Pioneers.
		- Finisher bonus nerfed to lose 1 free tech and disallow purchasing Great Scientists with Faith. However, it also now adds +4 Science and Production to Academies during Golden Ages.
	- Constitution
		- Conceptually this is supposed to be the Freedom analogue, but ended up taking more after Aesthetics, resulting in an overpowered, unfocused mess. This tree receives some of the most severe nerfs.
		- The tree no longer boosts growth at all.
		- Civil Society also loses its Unhappiness reduction from specialists (this is moved to Harmony), and instead increases City Strength by 25%.
		- Protected Speech's old effect of +1 Culture per 3 population in your cities has been thrown out because it was giving too much Culture. It now cuts the production time of Culture buildings in half. It also adds +2 Culture instead of +1 to Town Halls.
		- Public Good's old effect has been thrown out; it now adds +1 Water/Happiness to Water Storage units, Hospitals, Town Halls, and Broadcast Towers.
		- Legislative Process loses the +1 Happiness per 5 population bonus and is reduced to 20% extra Great Administrator generation (in accordance with other trees only boosting their respective Great Person by 20% instead of 25%), but awards a free Great Administrator to compensate.
		- Voting Rights loses the 25% Strength penalty while the empire is unhappy.
		- The finisher bonus is nerfed to +4 of the respective primary yield to each non-evil Great Improvement (+2 of each primary yield for Settlements, Wasteland Stations, Citadels, and Preservators) instead of double yields. Yes, this means other expansion mods with unique Great Improvements get shafted, and I do mean to address that at a later time.
	- Supremacy
		- The opener no longer gives free upkeep to units.
		- Police State no longer gives +3 Happiness to Prison Camps (that bonus is moved to Listening Posts); instead it adds +3 Production to those buildings and Work Camps. Town Hall also loses its +1 Happiness from the policy. Annexed and puppeted cities no longer have a Food malus. The production time of Listening Posts is cut in half.
		- Spoils of War now provides double Slaves instead of Autocracy.
		- The finisher bonus now adds +2 Food/Production/Water to every owned city while you have Slaves and +4 of the respective primary yield to each evil Great Improvement (Crystal Refinery, Narcotics farm, Oracle, Outpost, Prison farm). However, the combat bonus is reduced to 15%, but it no longer has an expiration date.
	- Monopoly
		- The opener bonus now adds +1 Culture to Markets instead of +33% Water to the Council.
		- The tree no longer adds extra Water to Factories or Work Camps aside from Privatization retaining its +2 to the former.
		- Mass Consumption's old effect has been thrown out; it instead adds +1 Water to Moisture traps/Water pumps and +25% more gifted resources from City-States.
		- Venture Capital adds +2 Water to the four main Water buildings instead of reducing item purchase cost (this was moved to Privatization).
		- Privatization's stat penalties were removed. It is no longer a game-breaking policy thanks to the Hazard Pay nerf.
		- Entrepreneurship loses the extra GM generation and receives the reduced road maintenance which was part of Privatization + a buffed building maintenance cost reduction moved from the finisher bonus, and adds +2 Science to the main four Water buildings.
		- Corporate Personhood now requires Entrepreneurship in addition to Privatization.
		- The finisher bonus adds further yields to Moisture traps, Water pumps, Narcotics farms, Settlements and Wasteland Stations (+1 Water/Food for the first two, +2 Water/Science/Culture for Narcotics farms and Settlements, +2 Water/Food/Production for Wasteland Stations), but loses the tile purchase discount. It also awards a free Great Merchant.
	- Collectivism
		- The opener is nerfed to reduce the bonus to Great Engineer generation to 20%. However, it now unlocks access to a new mercenary unit.
		- Re-Education loses the Culture penalties but also loses the Happiness bonuses; it instead adds +1 Production/Science to Factories, Prison Camps and Work Camps.
		- Nationalization is replaced with Expropriation, which reduces Water costs of purchasing settlers and tiles to aid mid-game expansion (the old policy's effect was moved to the Workers' Facility in a nerfed form).
		- Political Officers now requires Re-Education and boosts unit production instead of unit/city strength. Aircraft are excluded from the bonus.
		- Shared Vision now requires both Re-Education and Expropriation and loses the previous Production/maintenance cost reduction bonuses but adds 10% Production to every Factory and 15% Production to the Council.
		- Workers' Union no longer adds flat Production to your cities.
		- The finisher bonus is buffed to add +2 Water/Science to every owned city and award a free Great Engineer.
	- Naturalism
		- The opener is buffed to add +2 Food/Culture to all cities instead of +1 and a +20% bonus to Great Farmer generation.
		- Emissions Standards removes the Production penalty to Coal Plants and adds an extra +1 Happiness/Culture to Recycling Plant and Carbon Capture buildings, along with +2 Production and +1 Power to Solar collectors and Wind farms. With the adjustments to Recycling Plants, it's finally no longer a bad policy.
		- Physiolatry loses the Science penalty and gains extra Food, Production and Culture yields.
		- Ecodefense is adjusted to make this ideology *more* warlike; it now unlocks access to a new unit who only exists to commit war crimes and provides 3 of them for free.
		- Harmony gains the old effects of Differential Rationing and Civil Society to replace the lackluster stat bonus to cities of size 7+.
		- Conservation buffs Farmer specialists to return +2 Water and adds +2 Water to Rainwater Purifiers.
		- The finisher bonus loses the Faith purchase on Great Farmers (which was moved to Adaptation's finisher) but awards 2 of them for free, and now adds a 10% Production boost towards building the Utopia Project (moved here from Bionics Complete).
	- Mechanization
		- All of the Food/Growth maluses and population cullings have been removed.
		- The opener is adjusted to add 5% Production in all cities and lose the Science boost/Culture penalty.
		- Automation loses the Science boost and now adds +2 Production/Happiness to Factories and Automated Factories.
		- Logistics renamed to Integrated Attack Logistics and loses the minor healing bonus and Unit Supply bonus, but adds 50% Production to Automated units.
		- Digitization no longer adds Faith to Data/Decryption Centers. It now adds +2 Culture/Happiness to those buildings.
		- The finisher awards a free Great Engineer and Scientist and increases the Production bonuses to 25%.
	- Bionics
		- The opener is now +1 Science per 4 population instead of a flat +2 Science per city.
		- Weather Engineering now adds +2 Water to Moisture traps, along with +2 Production and +1 Power to Solar collectors and Wind farms, making it much more useful.
		- Eugenics's Unhappiness reduction and +2 Faith from having +2 active Specialists replaced with +2 Happiness from having 2+ active Specialists. The Strength bonus to Personnel units is increased to 25% and it adds +25 starting XP to Personnel units.
		- Cybernetics loses the weak +1 Production per 10 population and adds 25% Production towards Military units. Additionally, the old effect of letting Personnel units retain full strength while wounded has been moved to a new "AI Implant" promotion granted by this tenet that also adds additional unit healing.
		- Transhumanism adds a 33% reduction to Unhappiness in the Capital and no longer reduces Faith purchase costs.
		- The finisher bonus now awards a free Great General and Great Scientist instead of letting the player choose any one free Great Person, and adds a Production bonus towards the Biosphere Project and Terraformer Parts, along with the Colony Ship Project and Colony Ship Parts for players pursuing a Colonization Victory.

Belief Changes:
- General
	- Certain belief categories now prohibit the player from selecting more than one of that type of belief (unless they're able to pick two or more of the appropriate belief type at the same time, which I need to figure out how to fix). This currently applies to: Follower Beliefs that add Food yields and Enhancer Beliefs that increase religious pressure.
- Pantheons
	- Terrain based Pantheons and Strength of the Earth are limited to only add yields to tiles that are in the first and second rings of workable tiles for cities following that religion. However, Strength of the Earth doesn't apply this restriction to Manufactories or the Mining Pit ancient wonder.
	- Pantheons that added Happiness to Natural tiles no longer do so.
	- Faith Healers is moved to Follower, only grants +10 HP of healing to units adjacent to the city, but grants a new "Healing Hands" promotion to Personnel units (boosts healing for adjacent units by +10 HP) and adds +2 Faith to Hospitals and Medical Labs.
	- Fertility Rites buffed to add +25% Production towards Civilians and +1 Food/Faith to Food Stores (and replacements).
	- Home and Hearth buffed to count every 5 population in capital cities for its extra yields.
	- God of Commerce adds +2 Water instead of +2 Science, and adds +1 Faith to Markets, making it an actually useful Pantheon.
	- Religious Settlements buffed to +25% expansion rate and adds +1 Culture, +2 Faith to National Wonders.
	- Sacred Waters moved to Follower and buffed to add yields to Greywater Treatment Plant (+1 Water/Faith) and Hydroponic Farming (+1 Food/Faith) buildings.
	- Sacrificial Fire buffed to add +10% Production towards Land Military units.
	- Strength of the Earth no longer adds Production to any tiles except the Mining Pit, which now gains +2 Production/Faith if it spawns and the tile's owner is following this belief.
	- Works of Genius nerfed, only adding +2 Faith to Great Improvements and another +1 to cities with an active Specialist (along with +2 Science to those cities).
- Founder
	- Primacy has been made **inaccessible** until such time as a fitting new effect for this belief to help bolster CS relations becomes possible. Its current effect still exists in-game, but has been merged with Religious Unity.
- Follower
	- Art of War moved to Enhancer and locked behind Exodus of the Evangelists. It no longer has an expiration date, but only allows purchasing land units.
	- Blessing of Peace moved to Enhancer, locked behind Exodus of the Evangelists, and adjusted to +20% growth while at peace, +2 Food to Barracks.
	- Feast of Flesh adjusted to add +2 Food, +1 Happiness to Ranches.
	- Happiness in Faith reworked to add +2 Production, +1 Culture, but only +1 Happiness to Monasteries.
	- Hymns of Praise moved to Pantheon and buffed to also add +1 Water to Shrines.
	- Labor of Love nerfed to a cap of +10% extra Production.
	- Obey the Elders buffed to also add +2 Food to cities with an active specialist.
	- Public Prayer buffed to +2 Faith per Town Hall.
- Enhancer
	- Illuminated Order's Faith discount on religious units moved to Philosophic Debates/Thought Control in a reduced amount (-25% vs. original -30%); it is now a Founder Belief that awards +50 Culture whenever a city converts to your religion for the first time.
	- Itinerant Preachers and Religious Texts have been made **inaccessible.**
- Misc.
	- Missionary Zeal renamed to Philosophic Debates.

Specialist Changes:
- Administrators are adjusted to +2 Culture while active and no longer give Happiness.

Promotion Changes:
- Forage was the second worst offender of OP promotions, and the nerfs are appropriately severe: it awards 67% less Science per kill and no longer gives extra XP or unit healing on kill. Instead it adds minor healing bonuses in Rubble/Ruins tiles.
- Skirmish was the worst offender of all, making ranged units far too strong; it is now exclusive to Scout units instead of Shooter units. Shooter units receive access to Forage to compensate.
- Precision and Suppression now list Forage instead of Skirmish as a prerequisite.
- Suppression nerfed to 25% bonus against Melee units.
- Hazard Pay was also far too strong, and no longer allows units to move the same turn they're bought.
- Chemical Weapons was yet another overpowered promotion, and its combat bonuses have been cut in half.
- The Reconnaissance promotion line was also too powerful to tolerate:
	- Level 1 no longer gives bonus XP from combat.
	- Level 2's old effect has been thrown out.
	- Level 3 has been split in two, with the anti-Siege and ZoC promotions becoming the new Level 2 and leaving Level 3 with just +1 Movement.
- Shock, Loose Formation, and Pursuit are no longer available for Scrapper units. Pursuit is now available for Armor units but is nerfed to remove the unit healing on kill.
- Bombardment has been split into separate promotions for Ranged Water and Bomber units, with two more tiers added for Bomber units, and it along with Siege are removed from the Fighter promotion list.
- Targeting is one of the few promotions that is buffed, now giving a 33% bonus against Water units.
- Survivalism has been removed from the promotion list for Armor, Helicopter, and all Water and Air units.
- Sentry has been removed from the promotion list for Shooter and Helicopter units, and its promotion requirements have been adjusted to address an error in the promotion tree.
- Evasive Maneuvers requires the second tier Fighter/Bomber promotions.
- Operational Range requires the third tier Fighter/Bomber promotions.
- Air Repair no longer lists Interception/Siege III, Sortie or Evasive Maneuvers as requisite promotions; the unit *must* obtain the Logistics promotion before it can obtain this one.
- Logistics no longer lists Evasive Maneuvers or Operational Range as requisite promotions, but lists Aerial Bombardment III as one.

Tile Improvement Changes:
- Artificial oases are now available at Land Remediation and can be built on Desert Swamps (gaining an additional +1 Food, +3 Water if built on those tiles). However, the Water they award enemy factions for pillaging them is doubled.
- Grasslands is severely nerfed to curtail its absurd adjacency bonuses; it only gains yields once with the appropriate tile adjacency instead of stacking, and no longer increases Happiness at all. However, it no longer drains Water from fresh water tiles, and gains +1 Food at Atmosphere Remediation.
- Moisture traps gain +1 Water at Atmosphere Remediation.
- Solar collectors take less time to build (10 turns on Standard speed) and gain +1 Production at Atmosphere Remediation.
- Terrace farms buffed to add +2 base Food with another +1 from having at least 1 adjacent Grasslands.
- Tree plantations can now be built on Hills and Swamps with the appropriate techs. Desert and Permafrost is still off-limits.
- Wind farms gain +1 Production at Plastics and another +1 at Atmosphere Remediation; if built on water they gain another +1 at Ocean Remediation.
- Most of the Great Improvements have been buffed:
	- Academies now gain +3 Science instead of +2 from the relevant techs.
	- Manufactories now start at +4 Production and scale to +12 from tech progression, along with +2 Food/Science.
	- Outposts gain an additional +4 Production with Combined Arms.
	- Prison farms gain an additional +4 Production with Social Engineering.
	- Seminaries now start at +4 Faith, increasing to +6 with Education, but no longer provide any Culture on their own.
	- Settlements now gain an additional +2 Water/Science from tech progression.
